            "LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported £20 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won't cast a spell on him. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I'll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking to say 'kid star goes off the rails,'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films.  Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter's latest » . There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called \"My Boy Jack,\" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year. He will also appear in \"December Boys,\" an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage. Earlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer's \"Equus.\" Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he's legally an adult: \"I just think I'm going to be more sort of fair game,\" he told Reuters.

saw her husband with his catastrophic injury and blood all over the floor and wall rogers told police he had hit him at least six time and had intended to kill him mr jones said rogers told a police

by a stranger her sister betty elston wa murdered on a beach in sully in by a stranger who had absconded from a mental health institution he told rogers expert psychiatric evidence is that your behaviour is explained by paranoid schizophrenia that is the explanation for the delusion and hallucination you had which led you to conclude you had a moral duty to kill mr hatch speaking after the court hearing mr hatch family described him a a kind caring placid gentle man who will be missed by everyone who knew him they said our life have been changed forever and we are devastated there is no

a fit of temper and attacked mr doyle who wa still helping pupil cross the road a child and parent looked on in horror the incensed businessman threw a punch towards mr doyles face it failed to connect but managed to knock off his glass he then punched mr doyle in the chest causing him to fall over backwards into the road where he sat gasping for breath the former pub landlord wa taken to hospital where he wa found to have suffered a fractured rib and a punctured lung kosovoborn rustemi from stockport escaped a jail sentence this week after admitting assault causing actual bodily harm and dangerous driving instead he wa handed a sixmonth suspended jail term ordered to pay mr doyle in compensation told to carry out hour of unpaid work and banned from the road for month mr doyle

boredom during retirement minshull street crown court in manchester heard that the incident happened at am on january while he wa working outside wellington school a secondary school in timperley greater manchester yesterday mr doyle who had to take six week off work following the attack said it wa an extraordinary thing ive spent most of my working life in the licence trade so ive had to escort my fair share of people from my premise but this wa something else what he did wa like going through a red light both myself and the child could have been run over ive been verbally abused in the past but i never expected to get hit but ill keep doing lollipop patrol until i stop enjoying it and thats even after getting a punctured lung i love the job and love meeting people ive got no plan to stop yet mr doyle who wa sent this get well soon card by pupil said he plan to continue his job a a lollipop man despite being injured by rustemi speaking of the incident he said i had dropped my lollipop down to draw the driver attention to the fact i wa in the middle of the road with two schoolchildren but he wa only about inch away from me a he went by he asked me what the bloody hell i thought i wa doing i said didnt you see me standing on the road he said no so i said you should bloody well open your eye then rustemi tried to argue that mr doyle had been the aggressor during the incident but police took statement from a number of schoolchildren witness who said the opposite he drove off and i thought that wa it then three or four minute later he came charging across the road towards me and hit me in the side much to my mortification i collapsed i have never experienced anything quite like that it wa just not being able to stand up at again i wa lying on the floor and couldnt stand up i had to crawl across the pavement to a wall and hauled myself up against it and by this time i had people around me i didnt think there wa proper injury at that point i wa just deeply ashamed that i had fallen and couldnt stand up again it wasnt until later in hospital having an xray they discovered that i had broken my rib i cant imagine anybody would drive away park the car and come charging back because of a sudden burst of temper this must have been something that wa festering for one reason or another sentencing him the judge mr recorder david heaton qc said you behaved in a way in front of your daughter and in front of other schoolchildren which is repugnant to rightminded people you drove along the road and it appears you failed to see mr doyle the school crossing patrol man who at that time wa escorting two yearold girl across the road so frustrated wa he by your driving that he perhaps unwisely allowed his crossing banner to drop on to your vehicle and no doubt that surprised your daughter and caused you to exchange word with him if matter had rested there i imagine you would not be here foolishly you went away but returned two minute later more angry it appears than you were previously and threw a punch at mr doyle he wa carrying out a public service escorting schoolchildren safely from one side of the road to the other and is a much older man i am prepared to accept you did not realise at the time but nonetheless an inexcusable feature wa his age the service he performed is one which parent of child up and down the country value every morning of the school term you assaulted a public servant you did it in front of child in the morning and to a man who wa significantly older than you i note you have not been well and that might be some sort of explanation for this extraordinary behaviour\n",

            "cnnthe reserve deputy who shot a suspect with his firearm rather than his stun gun and another deputy who can be heard cursing at the suspect after he wa shot were not in their normal state of mind because of the elevated stress of apprehending the suspect according to a tulsa oklahoma investigator tulsa police sgt jim clark who ha been brought in to review the case said tulsa county reserve deputy robert bates inadvertently shot eric courtney harris after harris a possibly pcpaddled felon who had day prior sold methamphetamine to an undercover officer ran from authority after trying to sell an illegal handgun during an undercover sting a deputy tried to handcuff harris bates arrived with a pepper spray gun in hand he warned his fellow deputy he wa going to use a taser on the suspect but instead he fired a single gunshot and immediately apologized clark said citing a recently released video clark attributed bates action to a phenomenon known a slip and capture an example is when someone who drive a car with a manual transmission get behind the wheel of a car with an automatic transmission the driver will press her or his left foot down when stopping abruptly even though there no clutch pedal he said quoting bill lewinski executive director of the force science institute clark further explained these are mistake that are made when you think you are doing one thing but you actually are doing another and the result often is directly opposite of what you intended in effect your intended behavior slip off the path that you want it to go because it is captured by a stronger response and sent to a different direction bates announced that he wa going to deploy his taser and he pulled the trigger only once a he wa trained to do clark said police are trained to doubletap when firing their handgun he said the gun jumped out of bates hand because he wasnt expecting recoil clark said and bates expressed surprise and remorse that he had shot harris quoting lewinski again clark said this is the slip and capture under time pressure to address a perceived threat his intention to draw his taser slipped off his agenda so to speak when it wa captured and completed by a more wellrehearsed motor program he wa not conscious of this unfortunate switch until after the shot wa fired in his urgency his concentration wa focused exclusively on harris back where he intended to place the taser dart because of whats called inattentional blindness meaning that he wasnt consciously paying attention to and registering it he wouldnt have been aware that the feel of the gun wa different from that of the taser and in this case the weight of the gun and taser are nearly identical clark wa emphatic that bates had done nothing criminally wrong and went so far a to say the reserve deputy wa a victim reserve deputy bates did not commit a crime reserve deputy bates wa a victim a true victim of slip and capture he said there no other determination i could come to when they set up the undercover sting police wanted evidence on camera but when they recorded the operation targeting harris earlier this month camera continued to roll a the suspect ran and a he wa fatally shot the tulsa county sheriff office released the video on friday the shooting wa an apparent accident it ha said in the last minute of the video harris lie on the pavement with police on top of him an officer call for a taser but in place of an electric clicking sound a gunshot ring out a voice can be heard saying oh i shot him im sorry another officer scream out he shot him he shot him harris who is bleeding call out too he losing his breath he say an officer yell back at him you fking ran shut the fk up he yell fk your breath he said clark defended the officer language saying the deputy experienced auditory exclusion never heard the gunshot and thought the suspect wa out of breath from running the language ha no bearing on whether the shooting wa justified clark said one deputy thought he wa going to have to shoot this person at the arrest site it very upsetting when you think you are going to have to take someone life and this deputy one of the involved deputy wa upset he said secondly this is total stress they are going after a dangerous suspect that they have no idea whether or not this person is armed clark added they did not know that he wa shot at this time they had audio exclusion they wa at a point where they couldnt hear they didnt even hear the gunshot go off the officer did not know that mr harris had been shot an officer can be seen in the video taking his foot off an object lying on the pavement not far from harris shortly after the suspect is shot the officer begin tugging harris hand behind his back a the video end harris later died at a local hospital police said at the time of the shooting that harris admitted to medic at the scene that he may have been under the influence of phencyclidine a street drug commonly known a pcp the video is edited to block out the officer face harris is clearly visible minute earlier harris had climbed into a truck cab where an undercover officer had set up a camera on the dash to record the suspect whats up they greet each other cordially without missing a beat harris rummage deep in a backpack and hastily hand over a semiautomatic pistol every few second he look around outside nervously sweet thats a nice gun man the undercover officer say off camera it a german luger harris tell him he crane his head around quickly and watch a a car pull up next to the truck officer in uniform jump out and harris bolt out the passenger door and sprint off he running he running he running the officer in the truck say a harris fled police worried he might still be armed because he ran with his right forearm pressed against his hip consistent with trying to maintain control of a gun clark said adding that no gun wa found when harris wa searched after the chase another video from an officer body camera pick up the chase the officer wearing it jump out of a vehicle and pursues harris on foot catching up to him easily he tackle the fleeing suspect the officer command him i need you to roll on your stomach now other officer appear someone call taser taser the gun discharge much later in the recording made by the first camera inside the truck two men are conversing he thought it wa his taser one of them say a the other curse in frustration in the background a woman is cry no no no harris had come to the sting deal with a female companion police have said that harris had reached for his waistband and officer feared he might endanger them when harris wa on the ground he refused to pull his left arm from underneath his body where his hand wa near his waistband they said after the shooting the officer body camera video did not reveal that area of harris body bates a former tulsa police officer wa placed on administrative leave after the shooting the sheriff office ha said asked whether bates age may have been a factor in the shooting clark said it happened to yearold law enforcement officer it happened to yearold law enforcement officer age is not really a factor in consideration for the dynamic behind slip and capture event despite the detail released over the weekend harris brother say he still want answer i want to know if he wa shot in the back accidentally or on purpose these are all the thing that not only i want but the public want andre harris told cnn affiliate ktul bates attorney scott wood told cnn on friday he would contact the network later he had not issued a statement or called back a of sunday cnns jason morris carma hassan and andreas preuss contributed to this report\n",

tribute to the phantom of the emirate one of the finest creative midfielders to have worn an arsenal shirt in the modern era it true they had booed his every touch and perhaps the loudest cheer of the game followed his yellow card for a dive but for arsenal it is time to stop being haunted by those they have lost or failed to sign and support those they have cesc fabregas wa booed by large portion of the arsenal supporter upon his return to the emirate fabregas wa cheered albeit sarcastically by the same set of fan when he wa booked for diving however when the chelsea midfielder wa substituted in the dying moment he wa given an applause hull away may swansea home may man united away may sunderland home may west brom home may there have been genuine sign of promise in n and reason for optimism in even if arsene wenger wa unable to add what would have been a significant other by ending his winless run against jose mourinho it is game and counting and while the arsenal bos insists it matter not a jot it is much to mourinhos amusement it about our club and our team not about me said wenger we wanted to win the game for the club what is important is what happens on the football pitch arsenal are third in the premier league level on point with manchester city but with a game in hand we want to finish the season well every game is difficult but we need to keep the focus until the end of the season we want to secure the top four then the top three and the top two before the fa cup final to finish a runnersup for the first time in a decade and successfully defend the fa cup can be framed a progress more significant is the development of hector bellerin francis coquelin and nacho monreal together with a philosophical tweak it ha made arsenal a more solid defensive unit capable of taking point from manchester city and chelsea and winning at manchester united in the fa cup coquelin and monreal were both ready to make smart foul at the expense of yellow card to stop the visitor a they sought to counter quickly this is not a typical arsenal trait bellerin ha been outstanding and few have contained eden hazard this season a effectively a the teenager did on sunday but arsenal need more defensive protection and plan to prioritise a defensive midfielder and a new goalkeeper in the summer we have closed the gap since the start of the season said wenger but what happened is that they had the experience at the back and could close the game down the buildup wa quick and sharp but the final ball wasnt there with five to play arsenal trail the championselect by point and must concentrate on catching chelsea in the knowledge their rival from the capital west will strengthen again in the summer amid the progress there remain reason for concern despite the flair overload of mesut ozil alexis sanchez and santi cazorla they could not break down a mourinho team determined to protect their clean sheet spanish defender hector bellerin left ha come on leap and bound for the gunner this season francis coquelin of arsenal evades fabregas of chelsea during the draw at emirate stadium on sunday ozil had glimpse of goal but branislav ivanovic did to sanchez what bellerin did to hazard chelsea finished the game with a midfield trio of nemanja matic kurt zouma and ramires which together with their usually resolute back four amounted to a sevenman defensive shield in the sky sport studio arsenal legend thierry henry questioned the quality of goal striker olivier giroud wenger ha to strengthen said henry in order to win the league you need great player i dont think you can win the league with giroud nacho monreal left is among the gunner player who have impressed recently and did so against chelsea chelsea struggled last year but they went out to buy thibaut courtois cesc matic and diego costa you see today the difference between a team that did and a team that didnt strengthen arsenal still need four top player those four would be straight down the spine of the team imagine arsenal if you threaded courtois john terry matic and costa through the centre of their fast and fluent side arsenal do not long for a fabregas they have player who can offer his vision and passing range perhaps the supporter who applauded him from the pitch have come to accept this thierry henry said arsenal will not win the premier league if they do not buy another striker but chelsea do have individual who would offer extra physical presence and matchwinning knowhow which would provide a platform for those like ozil sanchez and cazorla to deliver henry must realise this is not the wenger way but time for nurturing is running out the arsenal manager ha two more year on what could be his final contract if he is to close the gap catch chelsea next season and end this hoodoo against mourinho then it must be done in the summer transfer market\n",

hard to believe how rapid the change ha been economist brian jackson say the shift in focus towards restaurant and business that target china middle rather than upper class is a smart move on behalf of the developer many large mall and residential construction in china are all hoping to target one demographic the upper class he said what is needed to succeed is retail space that caters to the much larger bulk of middleclass chinese and he say other development that were once labeled ghost city have gone on to thrive one to three year is a blink of an eye in term of city development so many of these city still have time to fill and become functionaljackson said despite it retrofitting program the problem that have dogged the mall since it start will not disappear instantly most of

wa a standing ovation when the original star julie andrew came on stage however one country wa left baffled austria where the movie wa set and filmed we didnt really know what wa going on said one austrian i know each year people come to salzburg to soak up the magic and visit the location of the film it the reason threequarters of all tourist head to the city the beautiful flower bed of at mirabell garden in salzburg that sound of music fan will recognise julie andrew from the beloved film the sound of music fan of which continue to flock to salzburg the first tour started shortly after the film opened but now bus emblazoned with the sound of music circle the city day in day out and the austrian still dont get it youll be looking a long time in the salzburg tourist shop before you find a julie andrew postcard for sale let alone lederhosen fashioned from curtain fabric there are some real advantage in this if youre a fan of the sound of music and i am it mean there nothing to stop me from splashing about in fountain while humming that i have confidence or juggling fruit in the market perhaps not a good idea the old town where much of the movie wa shot is too narrow for tour bus and that fact combined with the lack of tourist tat mean there nothing to break the spell a you slide into the sound of music mindset also happily for fan of the film salzburg is a pretty conservative sort of place and doesnt rush about embracing change half a century after shooting the movie julie andrew could return to the city and wander round without too many shock to the system providing she overlooked the mcdonalds on getreidegasse sitting uncomfortably amid shop selling austrian national dress for me salzburg is the most hummable city ever although the tune you find yourself humming are probably not those that would be chosen by the city father lady gaga paid tribute to the film in the presence of it original star for it anniversary at the oscar built into the mountain in medieval time the church harnessed much of the local wealth that came from salt mining in fact it still owns a lot of the surrounding land and built the magnificent monastery and convent that dominate the city the real maria von trapp played by andrew in the film actually did become a novice at nonnberg which wa founded in the th century head past here around pm and youre still likely to hear the reallife nun singing gregorian chant bell peel at every opportunity and the mountain well it safe to say they havent changed much on my first trip more than year ago i stayed at an independent hostel the yoho wwwyohoat in paracelsusstrasse which im pleased to say is still going strong and still showing the sound of music for free each night then it wa a solitary outpost of rodgers and hammersteinbased enthusiasm but now there are encouraging sign that the rest of austria may just be starting to catch on sound of music tourism began almost immediately after the film release and is still going strong my hotel for this trip the rather more luxurious castellani parkhotel show the film on a continual loop on one of it tv channel i could wake up to climb evry mountain and nod off to sixteen going on seventeen and i did it wa an ideal base for a sound of music weekend the hotel even ha it own wedding chapel a gorgeous baroque concoction created during it day a an aristocratic mansion it ha to be said that breakfast doesnt really feature in the film which is the perfect excuse to start the day with apple strudel and the best place to do so cafe tomaselli salzburg oldest dating from the th century right in the centre of the city in alter markt the coffee is strong served in multiple way while it strudel ha spiced apple and crisp pastry and is drenched in enough sugar to start an avalanche then it time to tick off a few of the key sight first up the residenzplatz just outside the cafe in the movie it draped with nazi flag cafe tomaselli salzburg oldest date back to the th century and is in the centre of the city in alter markt rumour ha it that a the second world war had ended just year earlier the city authority werent keen on the flag but the producer won them round by saying that the alternative wa to use original footage of the german annexation of austria in the film then there st peter cemetery a series of catacomb that the movie set designer used a inspiration for the flight scene and the felsenreitschule the openair theatre that wa used for the concert scene now it show opera and concert a for the salzach the river that the city straddle you cross it via the mozart bridge used by maria and the child a they sang doremi the mirabell garden on the other side of the river allow an even fuller expression of appreciation for the film pat the head of the stone dwarf jump up and down the step run about a lot many people do it and even more hearteningly post the result on youtube and all the time austrian are just enjoying walking in the garden completely oblivious next to a palace built by an archbishop for his child particularly noteworthy in a catholic country residenzplatz just outside cafe tomaselli wa draped in nazi flag in the yearold film but to really immerse yourself in the full experience and to see the more outlying location you have to take a tour ive taken a few in my time i tend to feel them calling me each time i head to salzburg just a maria felt the mountain calling her over the year ive been accompanied on them by group ranging from unthrilled austrian to upforit australian in dirndl who had u singing the different part of the lonely goatherd a we headed into the mountain this time however i wa accompanied by gerry an austrian whod actually seen the film a well a brit load american and a family from malaysia we headed to hellbrunn where the gazebo from sixteen going on seventeen is now housed and now locked after too many fan tried to leap from bench to bench and injured themselves we also passed the house that served a the main location for the von trapp family home it now part of the mozarteum music academy and the easiest way to stay there is to become a topflight musician sarah turner found herself singing along to the lonely goatherd with upforit australian in dirndl we then started climbing our way into the mountain that feature in the opening shot now augmented with nice chalet a this area is a popular escape for posh austrian and german and gazed down at the town of fuschl and it lake one of austria most famous view british airway offer return flight from gatwick to

is crucial she is one of america greatest modern creation laurene job pictured widow of apple steve ha strongly backed hillary clinton for president laurene job said that hillary clinton right ha judgment and wisdom based on her public service her decade in our public life must not blind u to the fact that she represents new reality and possibility indeed those same decade have conferred upon her what newness usually lack judgment and even wisdom it matter of course that hillary is a woman but what matter more is what kind of woman she is mr clinton announced her intention to seek the democratic nomination on sunday and set upon the campaign trail with a trip to meet ordinary voter in iowa but she wa blasted for her staged visit on tuesday morning to a coffee shop in leclaire iowa austin bird one of the men pictured sitting at the table with mr clinton claimed the whole event wa orchestrated from beginning to end staged clinton sat to talk with three young iowan at a coffee shop on tuesday all of whom were driven to the event by her iowa campaign political director not so ordinary austin bird is a democratic party insider who chauffeured vice president joe biden around davenport iowa in october during a preelection campaign trip bird told daily mail online that campaign staffer troy price called and asked him and two other young people to meet him tuesday morning at a restaurant in davenport a nearby city price then drove them to the coffee house to meet clinton after vetting them for about a halfhour the three got the lion share of mr clinton time and participated in what breathless news report described a a roundtable the first of many in her brief iowa campaign swing bird himself is a frequent participant in iowa democratic party event he interned with president obamas presidential reelection campaign and wa tapped to chauffeur vice president joe biden in october when he visited davenport what happened is we were just asked to be there by troy bird said wednesday in a phone interview we were asked to come to a meeting with troy the three of u at the village inn the other two he confirmed were university of iowa college democrat president carter bell and planned parenthood of the heartland employee sara sedlacek it wa supposed to be a strategy meeting bird recalled to get our thought about issue but then all of a sudden he say hey we have secretary clinton coming in would you like to go meet her and then we got in a car troy car and we went up to the coffee house and we sat at a table and then hillary just came up and talked with u bird said we all were called i mean troy asked u all to do to go to a meeting with him and we didnt really know what it wa about i mean he did he knew it unclear how many iowan featured in photograph with clinton that rocketed around the country on tuesday were planted the mayor of leclaire wa there and his wife wa there bird said recalling the scene at the coffee shop price wa executive director of the iowa democratic party until a month ago clinton team tapped him last week to be it political director in iowa he did not respond to a request for comment bird is a government and community relation coordinator at genesis health system in davenport iowa according to his linkedin profile a coworker at genesis said wednesday that bird is basically a lobbyist in training thats what he want to do bird disagreed saying his role wa more public relation he also an outspoken progressive whose facebook wall show he ordered a hillary for president bumper sticker month ago is it yet he wrote in may clinton nascent campaign ha carefully coordinated her image a a spontaneous handshaking populist in her first day a a candidate posing with pennsylvanian at a gas station and venturing into an ohio chipotle restaurant for lunch when no one recognized the former first lady she wa wearing sunglass the campaign leaked information to the new york time so it reporter could get securitycamera footage to prove she had tried to mingle with voter scripting supposedly offthecuff appearance is common in presidential politics but could hurt clinton especially hard since her gonzo roadtrip journey to america broad midwest is designed to counter her image a cold calculating and politically venomous and planting party insider in place of typical iowan wont go over well in the hawkeye state where pressing the flesh and collecting caucus vote is a quadrennial fullcontact sport astroturf setting up faux event for news camera is nothing new in politics but iowan take presidential contest seriously and could punish clinton for the deception the fixer bird said troy prince left pictured with vp joe biden who wa executive director of the iowa democratic party until he left last month to help clinton statewide political effort recruited him and others to attend the spontaneous coffee meeting clinton campaign ha already taken heat for depicting at least three people in her campaign launch video a everyday american who were actually partisan with political connection one wa even a former campaign manager for wendy davis the texas democrat who mounted a

have supported a move to prosecute scroll down for video director of public prosecution alison saunders ignored the advice of to top qcs to charge lord janner police began investigating lord janner pictured after allegation of historic childsex abuse werer made in particular mr law pointed to overwhelming evidence and horrific corroborating account provided by victim during the exhaustive police inquiry but mr saunders decided that it wa not in the public interest to put lord janner in the dock due to his advanced alzheimers sparking a storm of controversy the latest revelation came a mr saunders endured a barrage of criticism for ending the case before it could reach court campaigner mp and victim believe a trial of the fact could have satisfied the need to get the bottom of the appalling claim against janner whatever his mental state figure from across the political spectrum are clamouring for the decision be reversed amid fear of a whitewash last night two senior government figure joined the chorus of disapproval and said the concern were justified clare montgomery qc right and eleanor law qc left both recommended janner should face trial health secretary jeremy hunt said there wa something very strange about the decision and health minster norman lamb called for the matter to be settled by the court accusing the cps of heinous error mr lamb said the authority should examine precedent of people with dementia being brought to trial my concern is that because the dpp and indeed the crown prosecution service at a local level have made error in this case heinous error by failing to bring a prosecution earlier when there wa evidence there to do so he said this matter should not be concluded by the dpp and should be brought before a court there is a precedent of people with dementia being brought to trial with allegation a serious a this it seems to me that this is the right approach mr hunt said boris johnson and home secretary theresa may had been right to express concern at the decision i think shes right to do so and i think boris is right to do so a well because i think we all think that there is something very very strange here where someone wa signing official letter only a matter of week ago and is somehow escaping prosecution for something so incredibly serious he said meanwhile lord carlile a lib dem peer and leading legal expert said that although there wa strong evidence that lord janner wa suffering from dementia the decision not to proceed with legal action should be reconsidered earlier this week leading politician from seven party came together to attack the latest decision not to prosecute lord janner and demand the decision be reversed amid public concern of a whitewash the crossparty group led by labour simon danczuk wrote to the time saying a long a justice is not seen to be done and the greater public interest is not served the public will see attempt to investigate establishment figure involved in historic child abuse a a whitewash mr saunders announced last week that there wa enough evidence to charge janner with crime against nine victim but said it wa not in the public interest to do so mr saunders decision not to prosecute came after a twoyear multimillion pound inquiry by leicestershire police examining allegation spanning four decade it led to a furious public row with victim saying they will never see justice and police threatening a high court legal challenge mr saunders defended her decision saying it is her duty to make the right judgment even when it is unpopular but the daily mail can reveal clare montgomery qc offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute mayor of london boris johson pictured ha expressed concern over the failure to charge lord janner she told mr saunders it wa unlikely prosecutor would be susceptible to a judicial review if she took janner to court senior lawyer feared janners legal team closely advised by his qc son daniel would try and block the case with a high court challenge focusing on his ill health but mr montgomery is understood to have said that a long a prosecutor had the support of his alleged victim it wa unlikely any such review would be successful eleanor law qc who wa leading counsel to the investigation recommended that he be charged mr law pointed to overwhelming evidence and horrific corroborating account provided by victim during the exhaustive police inquiry mr saunders concluded that there wa enough evidence to prosecute but janners ill health prevented any criminal proceeding she appointed two of the country foremost dementia expert who concluded his dementia is at an advanced stage and would never improve they were professor michael kopelman of king college london and dr katherine humphreys of the south london and maudsley nh foundation trust at least men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offence since including six in the past year mr saunders ha told

            "they gave u sanitation wine aqueduct and road but it seems the roman also gave u one more addition to the list tuberculosis researcher have isolated bacterial dna of several strain of the disease from the body of mummy found in the crypt of a church in the city of vc in hungary they found different strain of tb bacteria that had infected eight of the body in the tomb and traced them all back to a single source mummified remains of yearold terzia hausmann above found in the th century crypt of the dominican church in vc hungary were among those found to have been infected with tuberculosis by the researcher they say the strain of tb they found all evolved from a single germ that had began infecting people during the late roman period professor mark pallen a geneticist at warwick university who led the work said by showing that historical strain can be accurately mapped to contemporary lineage we have confirmed the genotypic continuity of an infection that ha ravaged the heart of europe since prehistoric time historian have long taught that native american population were almost wiped out by disease such a tuberculosis brought to the new world by european explorer but a new theory suggests the arrival of seal and sea lion could in fact be to blame scientist believe the marine animal brought the disease to south america where it spread long before christopher columbus arrived in while estimate vary it is thought that per cent of the million people living in the america before the european arrived were killed by new disease carried by explorer anthropological geneticist anne stone of arizona state university and johannes krause of the university of tubingen in germany have studied precolumbian mycobacterial tuberculosis genome the team examined tb dna from yearold skeleton found in peru a well a other sample and compared them to modern genome they found a clear relationship to tb lineage in animal especially seal and sea lion the study which is published in the journal nature communication used sample taken from the mummified remains of people who had been buried in a cyrpt of vcs dominican church during the th century worker attempting to restore the church stumbled on the remains of nearly people in the crypt in the body had become naturally mummified in the exceptionally dry air the body many of whom had been wealthy catholic had been placed in the crypt fully clothed and in coffin between and walled up and forgotten for about year the coffin were discovered when a construction worker tapped on a wall during renovation work part of the wall gave way to reveal coffin decotrated with skull and stacked from floor to ceiling the researcher found that eight of the body they examined showed sign that they had died of tuberculosis five of whom had suffered from multiple strain it is the first evidence that mixed infection of multiple strain of tb were common in the th century the researcher found that all of the strain belonged to a lineage of tuberculosis bacteria known a lineage which still cause more than a million tb case a year in europe and america by analysing the dna from these bacteria the researcher were able to trace back the evolutionary history of the different strain they found by looking for genetic change that had occurred tuberculosis is caused by the bacteria mycobacterium tuberculosis the researcher found several different the mummy were discovered during restoration work at the dominican church in vc hungary above they found that they all seemed to stem from a single strain of tuberculosis that wa in existence between cece the roman dating support recent scientific estimate that tuberculosis first emerged about year ago although some have suggested the disease is ten of thousand of year old writing in the journal the researcher said phylogenetic dating place the most recent common ancestor of this lineage in the late roman period our dating is consistent with evidence that a strain containing the pks deletion wa present in britain by the secondfourth century ce the finding also suggest that at the time when the mummy died tb wa already raging in europe and killing large number of people even before urbanisation and crowded housing created devastating epidemic the dry climate in the crypt preserved the body and clothing of the people placed there in the th century the church where the mummy were found is in vc in the pest region of northern hungary shown above professor pallen who conducted the work along with researcher at the university birmingham university college london the hebrew university in jerusalem and the hungarian natural history museum in budapest said microbiological analysis of sample from contemporary tb patient usually report a single strain of tuberculosis per patient by contrast five of the eight body in our study yielded more than one type of tuberculosis remarkably from one individual we obtained evidence of three distinct strain dr gemma kay the first author of the study added that their analysis had revealed some of the tragic toll the disease wa having at the time she said poignantly we found evidence of an intimate link between strain from in a middleaged mother and her grownup daughter suggesting both family member died from this devastating infection\n",

            "cnnafter year of making the case that the education of athlete is paramount the ncaa now say it ha no legal responsibility to make sure education is actually delivered on it website the ncaa prominently state it our commitment and our responsibility to give young people opportunity to learn play and succeed and later it say that in the collegiate model of sport the young men and woman competing on the field or court are student first athlete second but the ncaa is taking a very different position in response to a lawsuit filed by former university of north carolina athlete the lawsuit claimed the student didnt get an education because they were caught up in the largest known academic fraud scandal in ncaa history in it response the ncaa say it ha no legal responsibility to ensure the academic integrity of the course offered to studentathletes at it member institution even with page of online information about academic standard and even though the ncaa ha established a system of academic eligibility and accountability that it boast of regularly ncaa attorney wrote in this court filing that the ncaa did not assume a duty to ensure the quality of the education of studentathletes and the ncaa doe not have direct daytoday operational control over member institution like unc it nonsense it double talk said gerald gurney a former athleticacademic director who is now president of the drake group for academic integrity in collegiate sport if you look at their basic core principle it all about academic the experience the integration of academic and the education of the student is paramount gurney said they seem to talk out of both side of their mouth the ncaa referred call for comment to an online statement which read in part the ncaa belief that the lawsuit misunderstands the ncaas role with respect to it member school and ignores the myriad step the ncaa ha taken to assist studentathletes in being equipped to excel both in the classroom and on the playing field this case is troubling for a number of reason not the least of which is that the law doe not and ha never required the ncaa to ensure that every studentathlete is actually taking full advantage of the academic and athletic opportunity provided to them said donald remy ncaa chief legal officer in it response to the lawsuit it also likened it role to that of the american bar association or american medical association and said that those entity are not sued every time a lawyer or doctor act inappropriately the scandal at unc involved thousand of athlete who over year were funneled into class that never met where adviser fudged grade and accepted plagiarism so that athlete who were falling behind in class could remain eligible to play sport mary willingham the unc whistleblower turned ncaa critic ha for year said that athlete across the country are accepted to college even though theyre academically underprepared and then pushed into class where little work is required the system of eligibility that the ncaa brag about she say is a sham why do we go through the trouble of compliance if we cant legitimize that the course are real and the education is real anyway it make no sense said willingham who recently wrote a book about the unc scandal called cheated if they cant legitimize that the academic are real and take no responsibility for that then why certify student semester after semester to play it lost it meaning for me the ncaas claim that it handsoff when it come to athletics seems to be a direct contradiction of what the organization ha been repeating for year not just in the rhetoric on it website but in speech by it president mark emmert and in court defending itself from numerous lawsuit over paying athlete for example before it lost a case filed by former ucla player ed obannon suing for the right of athlete to make money off their image and likeness the ncaa stood on the pillar of amateurism insisting that college athlete are paid with an education thats the defense the ncaa is now using in another class action filed by bigtime sport attorney jeffrey kessler seeking to make college sport a free market where athlete are paid salary based on their value in response the ncaa said that what set college sport apart from pro is education consistent with it commitment to amateurism member institution conduct their athletics program for student who choose to participate in intercollegiate athletics a a part of their educational experience and in accordance with ncaa bylaw attorney michael hausfeld who represented both obannon and now the unc athlete said this this startling inconsistency is unfortunately all too symptomatic of the ncaas shifting rhetoric and faltering commitment to it college athlete ncaa president mark emmert ha repeatedly proposed that what we live for is the education of our athlete but the ncaas record tell a far different story but rick burton professor of sport management at syracuse university said it not realistic to think that the ncaa would regulate every professor and every course an athlete might take at each university across the country i understand i think where the ncaa is coming from we would not let the ncaa come in and tell u how to run our chemistry department at syracuse university he said it sound like someone is trying to say the ncaa should have been supervising that department at the university of north carolina and there no logic to that he said the people who are saying the ncaa should be held accountable for academic at every school are just looking for an opportunity to throw rock at the ncaa unc which wa also sued ha admitted to the fraud but also asked for a judge to throw out the case saying the athlete waited too long seven year to sue and the educational malpractice theory doesnt apply unc claim it is protected by state law this is reminiscent of another ncaa reversal the ncaa which wa founded a century ago to protect athlete from dangerous and exploitive athletic practice now say it doe not enforce health and safety rule in fact in response to a lawsuit filed by the family of a player who died in the ncaa wrote the ncaa denies that it ha a legal duty to protect studentathletes a cnn investigation found that the ncaa ha failed to open investigation in several case where safety rule allegedly were broken it ha also fallen behind in imposing rule for concussion far behind even the nfl ramogi huma president of the national college player association and a leading thorn in the ncaas side for decade said this latest backpedaling from the ncaa leaf him wondering why the organization exists at all there nothing left the ncaa can claim it doe that is beneficial to college athlete or society one ha to wonder what doe the ncaa do if it doesnt protect player if it doesnt play a role in the education of college athletics it begs the question of why doe the ncaa exist and why doe it have a tax exemption\n",

vigor many kenyan had believed that security improved enough since alshabaab held nairobi westgate mall under siege for four day in september resulting in the death of people had it not the massacre at garissa university college would have been far worse some say two police officer were on duty but the number of people killed in the attack is plaguing kenyan with selfdoubt with the highest death toll since the al qaeda bombing on the u embassy in nairobi many are saying security is still not tight enough and day after the attack authority revealed that rapid response force arrived hour late allowing the killing to drag on so what should kenya do the answer is elusive the battle with alshabaab is not a new one and every attempt at countering them ha only helped stall the inevitable another attack more death here are some of the problem plaguing kenya security effort the notion of building a wall is somewhat grandiose since the border run some kilometer or mile even with a wall

interval chelsea dominated from midway through the first half but that did not prevent leicester from taking the lead on the break when matty james released vardy down the left vardy beat terry to the

had not scored for more than four year but he made no mistake sliding it low into the net the king power erupted a home fan detected an improbably fifth win on the bounce and another year in this lofty company but drogba soon punctured those hope when he reacted swiftly to beat substitute ritchie de laet to a low cross from branislav ivanovic and hooked it past schmeichel it wa a different game from this point chelsea had reemerged in a different mood there wa extra urgency about their game and they would go on to win by more than one goal for the first time since a win against swansea

            "lauren crawley wa given a new platinum implant facial palsy or weakness of the facial muscle can stop the patient eyelid closing properly lauren crawley a housewife from king langley hertfordshire wa given a new platinum implant that make it easier to blink again a she tell thea jourdan the patient a few year ago i started losing my sense of balance and developed tinnitus my gp referred me for scan which showed i had a large but benign brain tumour behind my left ear surgery wa the only option thankfully the operation in july wa a success but my facial nerve which wa wrapped around the tumour wa damaged id been warned that facial palsy could be a sideeffect but it wa still a shock seeing my face in the mirror the left side wa droopy apparently it the same thing that can happen after a stroke i felt very selfconscious but the problem werent just aesthetic id lost the hearing in my left ear a well a my sense of taste and my mouth became dry eating and speaking were difficult and worst of all my left eye wa permanently open and i couldnt even blink with it to close it i had to push the upper lid down with my hand the eye itself wa dry and painful to sleep i had to seal it closed with tape id been told that about half those with the condition do improve so i wa hopeful i tried lot of thing to improve the muscle tone including facial massage taught by a physiotherapist i also had electric impulse therapy to shock the muscle back to life but nothing worked it wa very stressful i stopped socialising a much in case people stared after a year it wa clear the nerve would never work again so i wa referred to raman malhotra a plastic surgeon at the facial palsy clinic at the queen victoria hospital he explained he could put a special platinum chain into my eyelid which would weigh it down and help it close by itself id be able to open the eye easily because the muscle controlling this wasnt affected apparently surgeon used to use gold but platinum is better because it doesnt irritate the eye inside lining it is also more dense than gold so you need only a thin chain which meant people would barely see the implant through my eyelid i had the operation under sedation and local anaesthetic in february last year surgery for a benign brain tumour behind her left ear damaged a facial nerve wrapped around it my eye wa wide open a they injected anaesthetic into my eyelid and the skin around my eye then made lot of tiny stitch into my eyelid to hold the chain in place it wa strange watching it all but didnt hurt i went home that day and the difference wa immediately obvious the eye gently shut and stayed shut of it own accord i could go to sleep without needing tape i cant feel the implant no one can see it and i can blink normally the procedure ha made me look more normal people dont stare a much it really boosted my confidence the surgeon raman malhotra is a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at queen victoria hospital in east grinstead around people in britain have facial palsy it can be caused by a stroke if the stroke affect the area of the brain that sends signal to the facial nerve it can also be a result of traumatic injury damage after surgery or simply because of a virus damaging the facial nerve this happens in bell palsy which affect more than people a year facial palsy affect not just appearance but lot of function too the facial nerve which rise from the bottom of the brain on both side then sends branch across the face control the tongue taste bud for instance and the salivary gland so patient may suffer from dry mouth most also have difficulty blinking because the nerve control the muscle that make the eye blink shut however it doe not control the levator muscle which hold it open while many patient will recover with symptom easing within eight week laurens facial nerve wa too damaged to regain function when she first saw me her left eye wa wide and staring because the lower lid wa also pulled down and sideways this can cause all sort of problem from dryness to injury five year ago i would have recommended a gold implant in the shape of a very thin bar fitted under the eyelid to allow her to close the lid the extra weight make the eyelid heavier so it close automatically when the levator muscle relaxes this procedure is used widely across the nh but i now believe platinum is much better it per cent more dense than gold so you can make the implant thinner without losing weight platinum is also inert gold will cause reaction such a irritation and inflammation in about per cent of people the left side of her face wa droopy until now i helped design a special system of individual link of platinum which we can join together with nylon to create a chain of the desired length and weight for lauren i used three link weighing g each this is much easier than stitching in a single bar of metal and then finding that it is too heavy or light this way we can easily add or remove a link in we carried out a study at queen victoria hospital using platinum chain implant on patient only two needed adjustment and per cent said that they hardly noticed the implant compared with just per cent of patient who had a gold implant the study will be published in the british journal of ophthalmology first we anaesthetised the skin around laurens eye then on a workbench i linked the correct number of platinum link to form the weight i required id previously done a trial run sticking temporary weight to the outside of her eyelid to check the weight i made an incision across the outside of her eyelid where it make a natural crease making sure not to cut through to the eyeball i placed the link inside this incision above the eyeball stitching the chain in place from the outside in before closing the incision these nylon stitch stay in place for several year before being reabsorbed by the body by then the link will be embedded in surrounding tissue when the chain wa in place and the eye wa open it sat above the eyeball so it did not come into direct contact with that delicate part of the eye even when the eye is shut the implant doesnt touch the cornea when lauren wanted to blink her brain switched off the levator muscle which keep the eyelid wide open the corresponding muscle the orbicularis occuli muscle which should pull the eyelid down doe not work in laurens case because it is controlled by the facial nerve the percentage of stroke patient who are affected by facial weakness however the new chain meant that the eyelid wa sufficiently heavy to fall thanks to gravity although it wasnt a perfect solution at first laurens eye closed more slowly than a fully functioning eyelid at least she could blink again over time the blinking get better a muscle tone improves risk include infection and bleeding but these are rare i hope the implant will last lauren a lifetime and that platinum implant will become the treatment of choice any drawback gold upper eyelid implant have been used for decade for facial palsy say saj ataullah a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at manchester royal eye hospital platinum is more expensive but seems to be better since it is inert and doe not cause reaction and a the implant are le bulky it also superior cosmetically this chain segment innovation seems to work well any procedure can result in postoperative problem but these appear to be rare longerterm followup is needed before we can conclude that chainlink implant are truly superior to other platinum weight such a bar but they are promising so far the operation cost around privately the nh doe not automatically fund it\n",

            "cnnits no surprise which image is making the headline from this week gathering of leader from nearly three dozen nation in panama a historic handshake between president barack obama and cuban president raul castro but this first meeting of obama and castro since they announced plan to start normalizing diplomatic tie should not be the end of the summit story or at least obama is hoping it wont be after all the president ha had some unhappy experience at hemispheric summit where the headline have often focused on some le than flattering moment the reality is that the united state ha been losing ground in this increasingly important region and obama need to put on a strong performance in panama at the summit of the america if the u is to have a chance of improving tie with neighbor who should be best friend but who have drifted away a america ha been focused on challenge at home and instability in the middle east unfortunately america ha lost influence in latin america to a hyperactive china a cunning russia and a troubling iran all of which have made inroad in the region at washington expense this gathering therefore offer a chance for the u to reverse the tide and build on the potential offered by a natural alliance strengthened by million of people with latin american and caribbean blood who make their home in the united state the foundation for a strong hemispheric bloc are there but they need attention and the panama meeting offer a good opportunity to start building but first do no harm large diplomatic gathering are minutely orchestrated event and the u with it vast experience in preparing for highlevel multilateral meeting know the importance of dotting the is and crossing the t but this hasnt stopped recent summit descending into diplomatic and pr disaster for the u just look at the last summit held in cartagena colombia which stayed in the news much longer than anyone expected after secret service agent embarrassed the united state by hiring prostitute and bringing them to their hotel room in violation of basic security protocol they were reportedly caught after one of the woman accused an agent of refusing to pay an agreed fee a a result of all this the american looked dumb incompetent and cheap and back in the president new on the job wa caught flat footed by a fasttalking fiery antiamerican president of venezuela the late hugo chavez outplayed the leader of the free world who had just taken office and wa trying to show america new outstretched hand toward the foe of the george w bush era the summit hit a depressing low for the obama administration when chavez walked up to obama and a the camera clicked handed the american president a copy of the book open vein of latin america which blame the region woe on the u and europe yet the problem in cartagena werent just symbolic regional leader lined up against washington which had refused to include cuba in the summit and vowed they would not hold any more of the gathering unless havana wa also invited america wa cornered all this stand in contrast to the optimism of the early clinton year when the president issued an invitation to democratically elected head of state of latin america which wa then breaking the chain of military dictatorship back then the u had just led the creation of the north american free trade agreement nafta and actually seemed to stand for something attractive to the region namely democracy free trade and economic growth thats what it should aim for every time articulating a clear vision and rallying neighbor behind it can obama manage something similar this time true the president ha come armed with his new cuba policy unfortunately in an effort to placate critic who say obama is not doing more for prodemocracy activist the white house ha miscalculated with venezuela handing the repressive regime of chavez successor nicolas maduro a stick with which to beat the u obama ha long and rightly ignored maduros claim that the u planned to overthrow him but a modest plan to impose sanction ha suddenly handed maduro who ha presided over an economic catastrophe in his country a way to portray himself a victim of the u something he will no doubt play that up in panama all this risk again reviving memory of past tension with latin american who already have complicated feeling toward the u over it cold war support for unseemly rightwing dictator a policy it claimed to pursue in the name of preventing sovietbacked communism from taking hold but those day are behind u today the people want prosperity they want democracy and they want the rule of law all of which leave a potential opening for the united state too many national leader are eroding democratic norm opposition leader are in prison in venezuela a prosecutor who criticized the president wa found dead in argentina press freedom is under siege in several country and corruption is reaching new high all of this suggests that if obama play his card right he will have the opportunity to explain to the people of latin america that their goal are also america goal that like them he support democracy human right the rule of law full freedom of expression and free election in every country the fact that he met with cuban dissident wa welcome and sends a message that he is not neglecting other issue such a human right a he recasts relation with cuba for the million in latin america that still live in poverty these freedom can seem like a distant luxury but if obama can show them that the united state is a true partner in effort to improve their life then he will leave a longerlasting legacy in the region than just a handshake\n",

adding this is because they have no plan to limit rent rise between tenancy or after your first three year are up worse than this labour planning new way for landlord to evict you within that period for example to sell your home or get it back for other reason these loophole are scary when you think theyre attached to a big financial incentive to use them because thats the only way they will be

bulwark and the german supply ship berlin are expected to be sent to the region in the biggest sign of the european union belated commitment to the cause prime minister david cameron who is two week from a national election in which immigration is a major issue stressed that britain wa not planning to bring any more migrant back to the uk italian prime minister matteo renzi whose country ha been faced with almost daily tragedy a rescuer pluck body from the sea called the eu measure a giant step forward but other eu leader were le optimistic with malta prime minister joseph muscat saying the asset being proposed would never be enough to address the problem a giant step forward italian prime minister matteo renzi speaks after eu leader agreed a package of measure to tackle the growing migrant crisis including extra military and a tripling of funding for patrol jovial danish prime minister helle thorning schmidt and her british counterpart david cameron embrace before posing for a family photo during a european union leader summit in brussels the pledge of resource came a victim of the worstever migrant disaster in the mediterranean were buried thursday in malta two dozen wooden casket containing the only body recovered from a weekend capsizing off libya that left at least migrant feared dead were laid out for a memorial service none of the body wa identified one casket had no scrawled on it referring to the number of the dna sample taken from the corpse in case a relative ever come to claim it for several year a death toll mounted eu leader have done little more than deplore the loss of life and mark tragedy with moment of silence and wreath instead of fundamental action when libya disintegrated politically after the overthrow of longtime leader muammar gaddafi and unrest spread in neighboring country europe failed to take forceful action yesterday eu leader pledged to do more committing at least nine vessel to monitor the water for trafficker and intervene in case of need other member state from france to latvia also lined up more ship plane and helicopter that could be used to rescue migrant the member state agreed to triple funding to million m a month for the eu border operation that patrol the mediterranean seek and destroy britain will send one of it biggest warship hm bulwark above to the mediterranean within day a part of plan to target boat used by human trafficker escalating crisis a migrant is stretchered off to hospital by the italian red cross at the port of salerno after being rescued by the tanker chimera along with other refugee in the mediterranean they also assigned eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini to line up the diplomatic option that would allow eu military to strike against the boat used by trafficker official said the lack of a strong libyan government would likely make un backing necessary leader have already pledged significantly greater support including many more vessel aircraft and expert than had been anticipated before the summit eu president donald tusk said despite the sudden deluge of goodwill huge question remained about whether it would be enough to defeat the smuggler and human trafficker right now it a question of fixing yesterday error french president francois hollande said he said the eu would hold a summit in malta with african country by this summer to see how the continent can work together to better deal with a crisis that ha grown dramatically in recent year in contrast to the italian premier the head of another mediterranean nation on the frontline of the tragedy wa far le enthusiastic for tiny malta the smallest eu member state with a population of the summit produced nothing particularly new apart from a fresh resolve to break up the smuggling network the asset being proposed will never be enough malta prime minister joseph muscat said it is definitely not enough if the number that are being communicated about prospective migratory flow are anything to go by on the offensive eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini pictured ha been assigned to line up the diplomatic option that would allow eu military to strike against the boat used by trafficker in the past week alone more than people have been plucked from the sea between italy and libya a desperate migrant fleeing war and poverty threw their lot in with smuggler who charged up to for a spot on overcrowded boat to make the perilous crossing at least people have died in april alone putting on track to be the deadliest year ever ending that is europe main challenge even optimist say any measure agreed at thursday summit would not fully stem the tide of unstable ship crossing the mediterranean but dutch prime minister mark rutte insisted that europe should not take the brunt of blame we also ask that africa the source of the problem also collectively take up it responsibility rutte said last time i checked libya wa in africa not europe german chancellor angela merkel and french president francois hollande arrive at an eu emergency summit in brussels seeking a solution to the migrant crisis over the past year what little political structure libya had ha collapsed there are two rival government neither with any real authority and each fighting the other on the ground local militia hold sway around the country some of them with hardline islamist ideology and the islamic state group ha emerged a a strong and brutal force the make any military action against trafficker there even more complicated any kind of military action can only be based on international law said german chancellor angela merkel there are two possibility either a un security council resolution or a unity government in libya we have neither at the moment europe itself wa hardly a picture of unity when it came to the difficult issue of resettling migrant country like germany sweden france and italy have dealt with a disproportionate number of asylum request while many eastern and baltic member state take hardly any five of the member state are handling almost per cent of the migrant coming in still despite the difference finland prime minister alexander stubb wa hopeful

careful review of the previous trial reinterviewing some of the key witness consulting with some of the medical expert involved in the case reviewing evidence adduced at recent hearing and staffing the case with the current prosecutor assigned to the case a judge then granted skuras motion to dismiss wow we dont even know where to begin overton said after hearing this news we are so excited about all god ha done in and through all of this he ha carried u through an appellate court majority opinion to overturn overtons conviction last year wrote that her trial wa problematic from the

felt cold he took a warm bath but a his symptom worsened the overtons took him to the corpus christi hospital for treatment he died a day later from salt poisoning a week after his death murder charge were brought against the mother the lead prosecutor in the case eastwood portrayed overton a a frazzled care giver that had force fed andrew cajun seasoning a a form of punishment which caused the sodium poisoning but during the trial the defense said the boy death wa accidental and wa likely due to a medical condition pica that can cause a person to crave nonedible salty item like clay sand or dirt the mother ha been behind bar for seven year separated from her husband and five child who are being cared for by their father and home schooled by a supportive church community that still belief

placed in overtons care ha also said that the child medical state wa not properly explained at the trial dr edgar cortes said the boy had development issue that contributed to his eating disorder i think that if were going to be fair if were going to be just we have to take all of the circumstance into consideration he testified at a february hearing part of overtons appeal teacher and friend who knew the boy have agreed that he had unusual eating habit and even tried to eat trash on one occasion andrew died a day after the overtons took him to the hospital prosecutor claimed he died after overton punished him by making him swallow spicy seasoning her defense wa that andrew had very odd eating habit or even an eating disorder called pica the boy sunday school teacher had actually tried to persuade the overtons not to take andrew into their care because of his development issue saying that the parent should think of the welfare of their other child but the overtons have said that even knowing what they do now they would still have welcomed andrew into their heart and their home he had brother and sister and a mommy and daddy what he called his forever family because we had to go through a lot of pain since then hannah overton told in eastwoods professional ability have also been called into question after the trial she wa fired by the district attorney office in nueces county in in she admitted she struggled with alcohol dependency issue and wa also taking diet pill during her tenure a a prosecutor though she ha denied those issue tainted her ability during the

the ongoing talk a he fielded more than a dozen pointed question on the subject during his daily briefing wednesday afternoon rotating between tough talk and a softhanded approach earnest said the time ha come for the iranian negotiator to begin to make the kind of serious commitment that international community including the united state will insist upon while the talk have been productive we have not yet received the specific tangible commitment that the international community seek discussion were scheduled to cease at midnight on tuesday if iran wa still unwilling to agree to term set

sanction the white house ha resisted bipartisan effort to put new restriction on iran throughout the last several month saying it would veto sanction legislation if it came to the president desk but

technical so there is still quite a lot of work to do but we are on it now and well keep going at it he noted u diplomat said it wa not true a lavrov suggested that key issue had been worked out the

leader in his field and ha been at bayern for almost year mullerwohlfahrt fourth from left sits behind pep guardiola during the defeat on wednesday evening hanswilhelm mullerwohlfahrt ha often courted controversy with his method he claim that a substance called hyalart which is extracted from the crest of cockerel help lubricate knee injury and take away pain he also swears by actovegin an amino acid preparation derived from calf blood in he prescribed more than injection of goat blood to st johnstone striker peter macdonald for his hamstring injury among those to have been treated by him are ronaldo usain bolt michael owen and jose maria olazabal mullerwohlfahrt claim to have administered more than one million injection at least half of which have been to athlete a statement from mullerwohlfahrt read after the champion league match of bayern munich against porto the medical department wa for some inexplicable reason made primarily responsible the bond of trust is damaged and on friday morning the club released the following statement fc bayern munich note with regret the decision of chief medical officer dr hanswilhelm mllerwohlfahrt to resign his medical duty at the club dr mullerwohlfahrt in particular but also his team have performed firstclass work for the club and it player over the year our sincere thanks are due for this fc bayern will shortly announce new arrangement for the club medical unit until then dr volker braun sport physician and consulting physician in trauma surgery and orthopaedics will support the fc bayern team at match pep guardiola had just fit player to choose from at the estadio do dragao and the bayern manager implied in his postmatch comment that the defeat wa down to the lack of available player we have player who were out a long time with injury he said their leg dont last very long it a tough result to take into the second leg but well give it a go mullerwohlfahrt come to bayern munich arjen robben during a bundesliga game last month guardiola failed to win the champion league in his first season in germany and is on the brink of exit again speaking at a press conference on friday guardiola said it wa his decision to leave i respect his decision that is all guardiola and mullerwohlfahrt have reportedly had difference of opinion on several previous occasion including over the fitness of midfielder thiago alcantara ahead of last summer world cup mehdi benatia franck ribery arjen robben javi martinez and david alaba were among those missing from the bayern squad on wednesday through injury holger badstuber and bastian schweinsteiger have also struggled with longterm problem footage circulating online appears to show guardiola aiming sarcastic applause at his bench against bayer leverkusen last week after centre back benatia wa withdrawn with an injury bayern say the announcement wa unexpected medium director markus horwick said we have no knowledge of this release so we can not comment usain bolt wa one of many athlete to benefit from mullerwohlfahrts treatment at the london olympics mullerwohlfahrt ha worked with the german national team a well a athlete including usain bolt and boris becker the bayern fallout will not end his work with joachim low team he is the best doctor in the world bolt said after being treated by mullerwohlfahrt at the london olympics in the doctor is a very very great man thank you doctor he previously quit bayern after falling out with thencoach jurgen klinsmann in the season but returned after the manager left the german champion return to bundesliga action on saturday when they face hoffenheim at the rheinneckararena usain bolt sought the help of hanswilhelm mullerwohlfahrt in the week leading up to the london olympics in at the time sportsmails jamie redknapp recalled his experience with the doctor there not much i have in common with usain bolt he certainly a little quicker than i wa at my peak but we shared the same doctor when it came to turning to someone in need of urgent repair when i wa a liverpool player i regularly used the trick and skill of doctor hanswilhelm mullerwohlfahrt to rescue me from another injury now bolt the greatest sprinter of all time is visiting his munich clinic to try and be fit for the london olympics which start in day ive read in these page about mullerwolhfahrts method being described by a senior figure within the u antidoping agency a frankensteintype experiment im not sure what that mean although with me he would use fluid taken from the comb on the head of a hen to lubricate a knee joint that had been eroded by a succession of injury he would tell me that it wa like high quality oil for the engine of a car he concluded that the fluid taken from a hen comb would lubricate the knee and allow greater movement i wa happy to do what he suggested to have the confidence to play again ive also read about him prescribing goat blood injection for hamstring injury his method are successful which is what ha drawn bolt around the world from his jamaican training camp and why so many go to see the man they call healing han among the sportsman and woman who have stepped into mullerwohlfahrts dimly lit office are steven gerrard ronaldo jurgen klinsmann dame kelly holmes paula radcliffe michael owen jose maria olazabal and maurice green there is talk of controversy about mullerwohlfahrts method but i wont have a bad word said against him i saw him many time and there wa never anything untoward suggested this is not a backstreet quack he is still bayern munich team doctor world renowned and a master of his art and they didnt seem to be doing too badly the last time i watched them in the champion league final bolt versus his jamaican training partner yohan blake is the golden ticket for london last weekend blake beat bolt the fastest man on the planet in backtoback race over m and m bolt then withdrew from the diamond league race in monaco and the alarm bell are ringing nobody want him to miss these game surely not even blake athlete generally turn to mullerwohlfahrt a a last act of desperation having exhausted all the local practice and medical skill of those they have been closest to you cant tell me that bolt ha flown all the way from jamaica to munich without trusting mullerwohlfahrts art and without searching for a solution a little closer to home like me he must trust his method and rely on his advice he is renowned for helping sportsman and woman like bolt recover from hamstring problem when i tore a hamstring playing for england i wa out for five month he is getting sportsman back on track within five week i only wish i had known about him then it appears bolt ha a back problem which may have affected his right hamstring it doesnt sound a if bolt ha suffered a tear more likely a tweak and if he is unable to trust his hamstring it might explain why some of his time have been sluggish by his standard didi hamann the former german international first recommended muller wohlfahrt to me when i didnt know where else to turn i hopped on a plane with the liverpool physio hoping we could find some answer when i first met him i wa anxious but he made me feel welcome and relaxed he wa in his s he next month but he had the skin of a man year younger with a shock of hair and healthy outlook on life he belief in the power of

a string of other establishment figure we now know from victim who have come forward following his death too many for the allegation not to be true that late rochdale mp smith wa a serial paedophile but wa janner detective have interviewed more than men who claim they were abused by janner in their youth it is suspected he used his hobby a a magician janner is a member of the magic circle to get close to them and gain their trust when he visited childrens home in leicestershire between and but the evidence will never be tested in court after alison saunders director of public prosecution ruled that it wa not in the public interest to put the labour peer on trial because of his age and ill health janner is a father of three his youngest daughter laura jannerklausner is an ordained rabbi and serf a senior rabbi at the movement for reform judaism his son daniel janner is a prominent qc janners wife myra died in and he ha not been seen outside his flat in hampstead northwest

last year alison saunders pictured said prosecutor will pursue justice for victim of child sex crime whether their case were day or year old but not in the janner case he said that he had sex with janner in a holiday inn hotel at the mp home when his wife and child were away and visited him in the common the jury were shown letter the mp is said to have sent to him on house of common notepaper some were reportedly signed love greville they are now in the hand of the police one wa alleged to have been penned by janner after they had stayed together at his home it feel strange not to have you flipping around me like a friendly flea the letter said in fact i miss you referring to an encounter in the swimming pool of the holiday inn mr winston said i wa fondled in my private area it seemed at first like a bit of fun being thrown around the water but he would hold me close beck used the testimony a part of his defence that he wa being prosecuted to divert attention from janner and other highprofile unnamed paedophile and that he wa trying to shield the boy under his charge from them paul winston wa not the only witness to implicate janner two others were called for the prosecution saying beck had raped them but in crossexamination they appeared to confirm some detail of mr winstons story probe greville janner left in served a an mp for decade and wa investigated in and janner wa mentioned during the trial of paediophile frank beck right who died in jail one a woman said she heard an argument between beck and mr winston in which he beck wa shouting that he wasnt allowed to see greville janner any more the other a man said mr winston had boasted about having friend in high place were the allegation made simply to muddy the water the jury thought so finding beck who died in prison in guilty of the majority of charge against him day later janner then in his s broke his silence on the affair by making a personal statement to parliament under parliamentary rule personal statement are not debatable so there were no followup question from mp janner told them there wa of course not a shred of truth in any of the allegation of criminal conduct against me during the trial meanwhile a my wife my family and i have had a taste of the suffering which beck can impose on innocent people will you join me in sending the real sufferer the individual who endured his home and whose life have been wrecked at his hand the profound sympathy of u all his statement wa greeted with cheer fellow labour mp keith vaz described janner a a brave man and others passed on leader neil

prevented by more senior people from doing so to put it bluntly the investigation wa blocked influential lord janner wa chair of the holocaust educational trust and vicepresident of the world jewish congress mr creedon said the decision wa a clear one he janner will be interviewed by appointment and there wont be a search of his home address or his constituency office of his office in the house of common it wa a decision made by people more senior than me the allegation against janner remained buried in newspaper archive until the authority began reopening historic child abuse case in the wake of the jimmy savile affair many revolve around the elm guest house a gay sauna in barnes west london where boy are believed to have been abused by a string of powerful men in the s and s

descended into the gutter and claimed david cameron should be ashamed deeply personal defence secretary michael fallon claimed ed miliband is so desperate for power he is willing to weaken uk defence to win support from snp he confirmed that a conservative government would go ahead with four new trident nuclear missile submarine to replace the existing fleet at a cost of billion labour rushed to say it wa also backing four submarine despite ed ball last month saying he wa examining the idea of cutting it to three doubt ha been cast on labour commitment to the deterrent because mr miliband could be forced to rely on the snp support to form a government snp leader nicola sturgeon ha made clear that scrapping the trident missile system which is based in scotland would be a red line for her propping up a labour government in westminster mr fallon launched a highly personal attack on mr miliband saying it wa an issue of trust and leadership he told bbc radio s today programme we need to be absolutely clear when we come to this decision in the next parliament we saw in that leadership election just what he would do to get into power we saw what he did to his own brother we need to know what he would do we cant be sure what kind of backstairs deal he is likely to do with the snp that is the uncertainty we have seen what he is prepared to do to get into power in a speech today he said ed miliband stabbed his own brother in the back to become labour leader now he is willing to stab the united kingdom in the back to become prime minister mr fallon will insist the tory would never do a deal on the future of trident in another coalition and that a man prepared to stab his brother in the back to win the labour leadership can not be trusted not to risk the nation security nicola sturgeon could not be clearer she ha told ed miliband that scrapping trident our country vital nuclear deterrent is a red line she will not cross the defence secretary will say if he want the key to no he must abandon any plan to renew our current vanguard ballistic missile submarine the snp childlike world view would sacrifice the longterm security of the uk the nuclear deterrent protects all of britain and the snp represents a separatist threat that would dangerously weaken our collective defence britain doesnt pay ransom and the conservative would never bow to demand from scottish separatist vow the attack come a the tory pledge to build a billion fleet of four new trident submarine mr miliband brushed off the criticism insisting he had got use to conservative attack speaking at an event in london the labour leader added the conservative party can throw what they like at me they can make all the personal attack on me that they want to but ive got use to it and you know what im resilient and im resilient for one reason alone because im fighting for the british people in this campaign im fighting for the kind of country the british people want mr miliband said that over the first two week of the conservative campaign it wa clear they have nothing positive to say about the country the labour leader said i think david cameron should be ashamed he got nothing positive to say about the future of the country he got no forward vision for the country and he sends out his minion like michael fallon to engage in desperate smear i think decent conservative right across our country decent conservative mp decent conservative party member decent people right across britain will say come on were better than this kind of politics there is mounting labour panic at poll suggesting the rampant snp is on course for a landslide north of the border such a political earthquake would be likely to leave the snp holding the balance of power at westminster and determining who is in government for the first time in the year history of the union shadow foreign secretary douglas alexander told the same programme that the labour party had made it crystal clear it support the renewal of trident he said this is desperate stuff from a rattled campaign that spent yesterday defending tax avoidance and is now descending into politics of the gutter this is not up for negotiation with the snp or with any other party i dont know how i can say it plainer than that we are absolutely committed to a continuous atsea deterrent the tory are like a wounded cornered animal at the moment snp leader nicola sturgeon ha made clear that scrapping the trident missile system which is based in scotland would be a red line for her propping up a labour government in westminster diane abbott who used twitter to question the billion cost of the weapon system labour leader ed miliband face a challenge from dozen of labour candidate calling for trident to be scrapped among them is diane abbott who used twitter to question the billion cost of the weapon system how exactly doe submarine system designed for cold war era combat new threat from international terrorism she asked renewing trident could cost billion would pay for new nurse million affordable home million job much more labour cnd list candidate standing for election on may calling for trident to be scrapped they call for a labour government that delivers on disarmament of the uk nuclear weapon a we are bound to under the nonproliferation treaty both labour and the snp have ruled out a formal coalition but left the door open to a looser deal that would see mr miliband in power even if he win fewer seat than the tory earlier this year mr miliband suggested he might back a cheaper trident replacement than the current plan estimated at billion for four submarine at about billion each and annual running cost of billion over the sub lifetime of about year today tory pledge put labour in a difficult position since ruling out any compromise on trident would infuriate the snp and many voter in scotland where support for the system renewal is lower than in the rest of the uk mr fallon will add today it is a sign of his weakness he ha failed to rule out a deal voter can only conclude he would be prepared to trade britain security just to get his hand on the key to downing street the future of our country security will be on the ballot paper too there will be a clear choice between a conservative government that will put our national security first or ed miliband a man so desperate for power he is ready to barter away our nuclear deterrent in a backroom deal with the snp liberal democrat defence spokesman sir nick harvey said he did not see any need for trident to be patrolling the sea while the uk ha no known nuclear adversary he told bbc radio s today programme the nuclear deterrent wa worth retaining but said two submarine would provide a perfectly meaningful deterrent although not on a continuous basis retaining three submarine would enable the uk to have a continuous atsea deterrence he added natalie bennett leader of the green party said this latest round of tory speculation doesnt conceal the fact that the labour party is committed to renewing our multibillion pound nuclear weapon system the truth is that the labour leadership ha made it clear that they will prioritise spending billion on a cold war relic rather than investing in the school and hospital that this country so desperately need only one party is standing up to trident across

drawn up by nh bos simon stevens commit the service to making billion of saving but also require an extra billion a year by the independent nuffield trust said failure to make the financial commitment would have serious consequence for the viability of the service chief executive nigel edward said labour stance wa regrettable adding the nh ha a plan which ha been endorsed by all leading

labour health manifesto launched at the weekend suggested a return to the topdown management style it used when it wa last in office mr edward said the level of detail set out in this labour document is somewhat concerning the nh is complex and often responds best to locally driven initiative there is a risk that element of this detailed approach could trigger further reorganisation shadow home

practical measure that will raise billion we can say where the money will come from the tory cant miss cooper also denied that labour target to cut tax dodging by billion wa simply plucked from the

specialist feared billy nose wa totally blocked with misformed and premature fused bone blocking his airway billy pictured with his twin sister lois ha undergone more than operation to have his face rebuilt but miraculously billy held on and in the morning he wa transferred to a specialist childrens hospital where he had thin metal tube called stent inserted into his nose to help him breathe he remained in a critical condition surrounded by tube and machine finally when he wa a month old mr and mr mitchell were able to take him home to join his twin sister lois and older sister darcy then five but he often stopped breathing in the night and at week old mr mitchell heard him cry apert syndrome is a genetic craniofacial abnormality that occurs in around one in to birth the condition is characterised by malformation of the skull midface hand and foot the skull is prematurely fused and unable to grow normally the midface the area from the middle of the eye socket to the upper jaw appears sunken some child with the condition have fused finger and toe early surgery can relieve the pressure that build up inside the fused skull a the brain grows and operation can be carried out to remodel a child face she noticed that his left eyelid had been pulled behind his eyeball causing his eye to pop out after rushing to a doctor he ended up having his lid sewn shut for a week child with apert syndrome have very small eye orbit meaning more of their eyeball is exposed billy eye orbit were so shallow especially the left that his eye regularly popped out of it socket doctor advised billy have his eyelid sewn together after he developed a corneal ulcer just six week later he needed a major operation to relieve pressure on his brain save his sight and reshape his whole head known a a front orbital advancement surgeon opened his skull detached it remodelled his forehead and pieced it together again like a jigsaw they also inserted two pin each three inch long into his head for six month the pin were turned twice a day to create more room inside his head to relieve pressure on his brain billy now need hour care which ha put a strain on family life mr mitchell said luckily paul and i had a strong relationship and we talked to each other about how we felt but darcy wa still young and had to grow up fast when billy wa four month old he underwent a major operation to relieve pressure on his brain save his sight and reshape his whole head his finger were also fused together leaving him struggling to clasp thing properly when he wa month old surgeon operated on him to separate billy finger and toe down to the first knuckle and a for lois every time billy wa admitted to hospital shed look around wondering where he wa but she wa thriving passing all the usual milestone it wa also clear she had a special bond with billy sometimes theyd snuggle up together when she learnt to sit up we propped billy up with cushion and theyd spend age playing together and when lois became mobile shed fetch billy his favourite toy billy finger were fused together known a mitten hand and so he struggled to clasp thing properly but when he wa month old a surgeon at leeds general hospital agreed to operate on them during a nine hour operation involving bone and skin graft he separated billy finger down to the first knuckle and did the same with his toe in a second operation he finished the process separating them fully mr mitchell said billy had all four limb in a cast for seven week but the result afterwards were amazing he grew in confidence overnight and a couple of week later learnt to sit up by himself bright a a button hed would watch lois intently and began to copy her a a family we were astounded by his progress so too were the doctor but the outside world wa le understanding and mr mitchell said people would whisper whenever she took billy out in his pram walking down the street one day i heard one woman say to her friend god he look awful earlier this year billy had another major operation which left him with a frame fitted to his face for nine week i wa so upset i went straight home another time when the twin were two and a half we were stood in the queue to see santa when darcy noticed some child pointing at billy she told them not to do it because it wa rude afterwards i overheard their mother saying well she shouldnt bring him out should she if only they knew what billy wa going through but determined not to wrap their child in cotton wool mr and mr mitchell sent billy to nursery and he went to exactly the same school a his twin sister lois despite his difficulty he ha turned into a typical little boy obsessed with car reading book and enjoying playing fancy dress with his sister since his most recent surgery billy love his new face his mother denise said he loved life and wa determined to join in with everything mr mitchell say in the summer of he underwent more major surgery during a ninehour operation surgeon took the left hand side of his skull off to remodel it and put it back with titanium spring to allow for more growth his condition also left him with a distorted face and his eye were becoming more and more exposed due to shallow eye socket and breathing wa a struggle so earlier this year he also underwent high risk midface surgery where his face wa literally taken apart reshaped and put back together again to create more room his head wa cut from ear to ear and his face cut vertically with the skin being pulled down exposing all of the bone of his face and jaw his forehead eye orbit nose and top jaw were taken apart reshaped and put back together with a red frame attached through a series of wire and bolt the frame wa left in place for nine week to encourage the bone to grow a well a pull the existing facial bone forward the bone were moved forward a millimeter a day by turning the screw on the frame a process which allows new bone to grow and then to consolidate mr mitchell said so far he endured more than general aesthetic and ha been through so much but since his recent surgery he love his news face when he saw it for the first time without the frame i think he would have done cartwheel if he could it wa a massive boost to his confidence and now a few month on he doesnt even associate himself a having apert syndrome but whats incredible is the way he taken everything in his stride we cant thank all the doctor and nurse enough whove looked after him\n",

            "washington cnnchief justice john robert is back in the spotlight robert who shocked conservative nearly three year ago by providing a pivotal vote to uphold obamacare once again face a judicial crossroad in a historic case the u supreme court will hear oral argument tuesday in a case that could decide whether gay and lesbian couple nationwide have the constitutional right to marry the question at the core of obergefell v hodges is one of the most consequential debate of the early st century and one that is already helping to shape the presidential race appeal court nationwide have moved decisively toward supporting samesex marriage but a split at the appellate level helped propel the issue to the nation highest court led by robert appointed to the bench by president george w bush robert ha a solid conservative record and would seem an unlikely vote to support a constitutional right to samesex marriage he dissented in united state v windsor a landmark case in which a narrowly divided court struck down a key provision of the defense of marriage act which denied federal benefit to lawfully married samesex couple and he expressed sympathy with legal argument that would allow samesex marriage ban yet both side see the case a a legacymaking moment for the yearold chief justice and advocate for samesex couple hold out hope that he will emerge a their ally they will be scrutinizing his word and action tuesday for clue about how hell vote and whether he will upset some conservative once again if the windsor majority vote in favor of marriage equality the ruling will be one of the most momentous decision of the robert court said judith e schaeffer of the constitutional accountability center which is advocating for samesex marriage will john robert want to be remembered a having dissented from such a historic decision for some conservative a vote in favor of samesex marriage in the case would be a huge disappointment it would be akin to the type of betrayal they felt when justice david souter who wa nominated to the bench by george hw bush and who retired in consistently voted with the liberal or when justice anthony kennedy a ronald reagan appointee disappointed them on earlier gay right case a well a abortion and the death penalty or when robert infuriated conservative ally by providing the crucial fifth vote to uphold obamacare on the ground that the law is a constitutional use of the government taxing authority the hope in conservative circle is that robert will see his legacy a ensuring that the issue of samesex marriage get decided by the people not the court the chief surely know that his job is to be on the right side of the constitution said edward whelan president of the ethic and public policy center blatherings about the wrong side of history are an appeal to intellectual cowardice those hoping that he will vote to uphold the state ban see a strong signal in the windsor case in his majority opinion kennedy said the principal purpose of the defense of marriage act wa to impose inequality robert disagreed he wrote separately to say he thought congress acted constitutionally when it passed the law in in an attempt to provide uniformity and stability at a time when every state defined marriage a between a man and a woman robert picked up on kennedy language that emphasized the state power to define the marital relationship and said that power will someday come into play on the other side of the board in future case about the constitutionality of state marriage definition david cruz of the university of southern california gould school of law said that robert could use that reasoning to vote in favor of state ban in the obergefell case robert is suggesting that concern about the power of state will support state law excluding samesex couple from marriage cruz said indeed the lower court that upheld the marriage ban in michigan tennessee ohio and kentucky in the obergefell case relied heavily on the argument that state have a right to define marriage another clue to robert thinking in the windsor dissent is that he took particular issue with any notion that the defense of marriage act wa passed out of a desire to harm noting it had the support of majority in both the house of representative and the senate a well a president bill clinton who signed it into law i would not tar the political branch with the brush of bigotry robert wrote the comment suggest he would reject an argument in the obergefell case that rested on the idea that samesex marriage ban reflected animus against gay people but backer of samesex marriage are reading some tea leaf of their own schaeffer point out that robert didnt join the part of the dissent penned by justice antonin scalia clarence thomas and samuel alito which clearly stated a belief that state ban on samesex marriage dont violate the constitution robert didnt join them in expressing those view schaeffer said at the time robert simply wrote that the court doe not have before it and the logic of it opinion doe not decide whether state can ban samesex marriage schaeffer said the chief justice could have simply chosen to remain silent on an issue that wasnt before the court but i think one reasonable explanation is that robert wa preserving a clean slate for himself on the ultimate issue of marriage equality she said the defense of marriage act decision overshadowed another case hollingsworth v perry that could have determined whether state could ban samesex marriage the case concerned a challenge to california proposition a state constitutional amendment that barred samesex couple from marriage but robert writing for the majority dismissed the case holding that the challenger did not have the legal standing to bring it to the court the ruling left in place a lower court decision that had invalidated proposition and thus paved the way for samesex marriage in california robert lesbian cousin who life in california sat in the courtroom during argument in the prop case few people predicted that the issue would return so quickly to the supreme court but wave of lower court judge sometimes citing windsor struck down the state ban on the first day of the term last fall the court wa presented with seven different petition on the issue conventional wisdom wa that the justice would garner the four necessary vote and grant one of the case but conventional wisdom wa completely wrong without comment the court declined to take up any of the case clearing the way for thousand of additional samesex marriage the court vote count in such decision is kept a secret and may never be known but some speculate on one possible scenario robert chose not to provide the fourth vote to the conservative who dissented in windsor then again even if the speculation were true it doesnt reveal much about robert thinking there a big difference between voting not to take up a case which express no opinion on the merit and issuing an opinion on the merit and even when robert action such a effectively allowing samesex marriage to proceed in california seem to suggest a willingness to consider such union nationwide his comment along the way make it much harder to gain insight into his ultimate thinking when the institution of marriage developed historically people didnt get around and say let have this institution but let keep out homosexual robert said during the proposition oral argument the institution developed to serve purpose that by their nature didnt include homosexual couple\n",

become the best player in the world sportsmail can reveal that is the unswerving message from the world most expensive player and it is one that is not set to change regardless of how persistent the rumour of a possible switch to manchester united become bale is injured and out of wednesday euroderby ii showdown with atletico madrid carlo ancelotti ha already gone on record a to just how important he belief the welshman is to real madrid gareth bale is adamant that he want to stay at real madrid despite strong interest from manchester united bale ha scored goal for real this season but ha still bee criticised by supporter bale hold off the challenge of atletico forward raul garcia during champion league quarterfinal he said last week he had a fantastic season last year and he is having a very good season this time he did very well for u in the final that we played and we need him for this season runin too real madrid million player is hoping to be back in time for the champion league semifinal should the holder qualify his future continues to be the source of much speculation with manchester united desperate to make a signing that would send shockwaves throughout world football and immediately install them a favourite to win the premier league next season real madrid have also privately declared their interest in making david de gea the longterm successor to iker casillas just a he is expected to be in the spain side bale is out of real champion league quarterfinal second leg against atletico on wednesday the wale international injured his calf during saturday win against malaga after just two minute the possibility of a balepluscash move for de gea this summer would certainly suit united and please those real madrid supporter who fail to see the value of bale and those goal that won the club three trophy last year but the player remains adamant that his future is in madrid in nearly all transfer wrangle the player get what he want over and above the desire of the club involved and it seems highly unlikely that he will be wearing anything other than a white shirt next season such is his desire to ride out the storm in madrid he had a sensational first season in spain winning four trophy and scoring in the copa del rey champion league and world club cup final this season he ha been the target of some postdecima criticism and even booed at time in his own stadium but he is determined to win over fan who have jeered some of the greatest player in history in their time bale enjoyed a standout first season in madrid and won the champion league and the copa del rey the former tottenham star scored a decisive goal in extratime during the champion league final last season he want to emulate cristiano ronaldo who also had to change the mind of the disgruntled mass and to eventually follow in his ballon dor footstep at the moment ronaldo and lionel messi are a considerable cut above everything else in football but bale see himself up against barcelona neymar a the young pretender trying to dethrone football greatest in the spanish capital while no one expects him to leave this summer nobody see bale desire to stay put a something that would necessarily prevent de gea from arriving at the santiago bernabeu at the end of the season to become his teammate carlo ancelotti said recently that if the club acquired a better goalkeeper than casillas then the spain international would lose his place and de gea is the man most supporter and the club director identify a the one keeper who would justify the coach leaving out the legend real madrid would like to sign manchester united goalkeeper to be longterm successor to iker casillas de gea punch clear under a challenge from john terry during saturday defeat by chelsea de geas girlfriend continues to live in madrid and her recent unflattering comment about manchester did little to quell rumour that family pressure are being applied on the keeper to return to spain he appears no closer to signing a new contract and last year louis van gaal made sure he installed victor valdes a keeper he know from his barcelona day a de geas no valdes wa given his debut by the dutchman and story coming out of old trafford suggest that for all his heroic shot stopping van gaal doe not see de gea a in anyway irreplaceable de gea spent one season in the atletico first team before joining united in for million all that point to the possibility of a return to madrid where he previously represented atletico but left after only one season in the first team despite his atletico past he ha none of the emotional pull that fernando torres once had leading him to declare he would never play for real the supporter would welcome him currently if they had to choose between de gea and bale they would opt for the goalkeeper providing there wa a considerable cash bonus for sending bale back to britain but they dont believe it will be necessary they see both men liningup for them next season bale desire to stay in spain will keep him at madrid it only remains to be seen just how much de gea want to join him in the spanish capital\n",

            "arkansas republican gov asa hutchinson said wednesday that he wont sign a religious freedom bill that his state legislature sent to him on tuesday citing influence from his politically liberal son he is sending it back to lawmaker he told reporter for amendment that will bring it more in line with the federal religious freedom restoration act which critic say better protected the right of gay and lesbian hutchinson said during his press conference that his son had in part convinced him not to sign the bill into law my son seth signed the petition asking me dad the governor to veto this bill hutchinson said and he gave me permission to make that reference and it show that there a generational difference of opinion on these issue seth told daily mail online that i love and respect my father very much but sometimes we have political disagreement just a many family do i had communicated with him my opposition to the bill along with thousand of other arkansan and concerned citizen around the country he added scroll down for video arkansas gov asa hutchinson is a former member of the u congress where he wa a reliable conservative vote on social issue but he said wednesday that he wont sign a new religious freedom bill into law like father like whoa the republican governor son seth pictured in a barack obama shirt signed a petition asking his dad to veto the religious freedom law about demonstrator flooded the step of the arkansas state capitol in little rock on tuesday after the bill wa passed by both house of the state legislature im proud to have made a small contribution to the overall effort to stop discrimination against the lgbt community in arkansas the state that i love go hog the younger hutchinson said seth work a a labor organizing coordinator for the austin texas flagship office of the texas state employee union most importantly he told daily mail online i hope that the groundswell of grassroots opposition to hb and other similar discriminatory bill around the country will energize more american and help create a longlasting drive for change in this country on many issue his father told reporter hour earlier that the bill on his desk carved out too much new territory the bill that is on my desk at the present time doe not mirror the federal law hutchinson said it doesnt mirror it in a couple of way particularly allowing the first amendment to be asserted in the private litigation between party or reliance on the state law in those claim therefore i asked that change be made in the legislation and ive asked that the leader in the general assembly to recall the bill so that it can be amended the white house jumped into the fray on wednesday with spokesman josh earnest telling reporter that the arkansas legislation could be used to justify discriminating against individual because of who they love and that is certainly not consistent with the value that the vast majority of american subscribe to earnest said and i think you know governor hutchinson is obviously responding to that outcry hutchinson didnt cite any pressure other than his son however my responsibility is to speak out on my own conviction gov hutchinson said at the state capitol and to do what i can a governor to make sure that this bill reflects the people of arkansas protects those of religious conscience but also minimizes the chance of discrimination in the workplace and in the public environment the unusual move sending the legislation back without actually vetoing it mean hutchinson doesnt risk a vetooverride in the state legislature lawmaker could refuse to amend the bill and force his hand or they could do what he asks josh earnest white house press secretary josh earnest reacted during his daily press briefing on wednesday the piece of legislation that wa passed by the arkansas legislature tracked closely with the legislation that wa passed by the indiana legislature last week the kind of outcry that we saw in response to the indiana legislation being signed into law by governor penny is similar to the outcry that we saw in arkansas last night after the legislature passed that legislation we saw you know some pretty strong criticism including from some pretty prominent business leader in the state of arkansas expressing some concern about the impact of that law and that that law could justifiably or could be used to justify discriminating against individual because of who they love and that is certainly not consistent with the value that the vast majority of american subscribe to and i think you know governor hutchinson is obviously responding to that outcry but you know obviously the next step will be for the leader in arkansas to determine i think weve made pretty clear what our view are on that the governor ha one other option he said he considering issuing an executive order to clarify that arkansas want to be a place of tolerance his concern that the bill went further than the law signed by thenpresident bill clinton wa akin to complaint that critic raised this week in indiana where a similar law took effect on monday one key detail in indiana version and arkansas expands the idea of giving conscientious christian a way to defend themselves if theyre sued when their business refuse to provide service for gay wedding they protect against civil suit filed by private individual not just those pursued by the government but few civilrights suit are filed and funded by allegedly harmed people state and federallevel commission and lawenforcement agency typically carry them forward and indiana university law professor deborah widiss told the associated press on wednesday that religious freedom restoration act law have not been a sort of blank check to discriminate at issue is whether a christianowned business could legally deny service to gay if doing so would conflict with their religious value typically the issue is raised when samesex couple seek vendor for their wedding let me make it clear hutchinson said wednesday this law under consideration doe not extend discrimination thats important what is important from an arkansas standpoint is one we get the right balance he said and secondly we make sure that we communicate were not going to be a state that fails to recognize the diversity of our workplace our economy and our future at the same time he seemed to defend the idea of having a law that protected the religiousexpress right of business owner this bill simply defines the standard to determine the right balance between those right and those of gay men and woman he said hutchinson had initially supported the bill and on tuesday his office said he planned to sign it this is a bill that in ordinary time would not be controversial but these are not ordinary time he said wednesday a american watched his quick degree turn hutchinson spoke to reporter outside his office at the state capitol in little rock on wednesday saying that he want a religious freedom law changed so it better reflects a federal law that took effect in dadwhisperer seth hutchinson seems to have had an outsize influence on his famous dad a arkansas braced for the possibility that it would become the new religiousfreedom ground zero walmart the state largest forprofit employer had insisted that the new legislation wa a bad idea those objection were unexpected in some corner because the massive bigbox chain is seen a a rare bastion of christian value in a crowded secular marketplace the walton family the company founder who still own a large stake are famous for using leadership model culled from christian service tradition walmart also is known for selling enough christianthemed book to worry some religious bookstore yet doug mcmillon the company ceo signed a statement saying that the state religious freedom restoration act threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of arkansas and doe not reflect the value we proudly uphold every day in our store we see firsthand the benefit diversity and inclusion have on our associate customer and community we serve mcmillon said arkansas legislator defied widespread criticism in passing the bill on tuesday a similar measure that indiana republican gov mike penny signed into law a day earlier became an instant national flashpoint in the gay right debate it took penny le than a day to capitulate to protester saying in a press conference that he would work with legislator to fix the law language flashpoint rally like this one in arkansas ould spread to the other state where version of the religious freedom restoration act are already on the book arkansas state rep bob ballinger right sponsored the bill and wa all smile when it passed but now his brainchild is in limbo we will fix this indiana gov mike penny told reporter on tuesday that he want legislation on his desk by the end of the week to clarify that his state new religious freedom law doe not allow discrimination walmart isnt the only big player that would have complained if hutchinson had signed the bill nascar said in a statement tuesday that it wa disappointed by indiana legislation and would likely pile on in the razorback state the ncaa which ha had it headquarters in indianapolis since say it is concerned about the law effect on future indiana event including this week final four men basketball tournament the governor of new york vermont washington and connecticut have announced ban on certain statefunded travel to indiana mayor of denver seattle and washington dc have followed suit for cityfunded travel those restriction could have quickly doubled in size to include arkansas josh earnest the white house press secretary said tuesday that the indiana law fly in the face of the kind of value that people all across the country strongly support the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether the arkansas bill would be equally offensive to the obama administration\n",

including the rainbow scale of their delicate wing some look like exotic bird feather and colourful ribbon while others resemble jagged autumnal leaf that change colour at the outer edge scroll down for video these stunning picture show the finer detail of a butterfly wing in stunning clarity including their rainbow scale a well a the beautiful colour they show the layout of individual scale which give the insect it iridescence this image show the wing of a sunset moth the photo were shot by linden gledhill from staffordshire who combine his love of photography with a phd in biochemistry the yearold us a modified microscope and a camera to capture the detail of the butterfly wing pattern his photograph show the pretty insect scalecovered wing butterfly wing are covered by thousand of microscopic scale split into two to three layer which give them their greek order name of lepidoptera meaning scaled wing each scale is pigmented with melanin that give butterfly black and brown colouring but eyecatching blue green red and iridescence are created by the microstructure of the scale rather than pigment themselves some of the scale look like exotic bird feather while others resemble autumnal leaf that change colour at the outer edge such a this beautiful image of a detached scale from a tiger swallowtail the tiny scale combine to give the striking colouration of the eastern tiger swallowtail stock image it is a specie of swallowtail butterfly native to eastern north america and is one of the most familiar butterfly in the eastern u where it is common in many different habitat each scale of a butterfly is pigmented with melanin that give butterfly black and brown colouring but eyecatching blue green red and iridescence pictured are created by the microstructure of the scale rather than pigment a papilio blumei fruhstorferi wing is shown the brighter colour on some butterfly are created thanks to the scattering of light by the scale such a these jagged example which are papilio ulysees butterfly scale in fact each scale ha multiple layer which are separated by air so when light hit them it reflected many time and the combination of these reflection cause u to see the intense yellow and blue of many butterfly specie the brighter colour are created thanks to the scattering of light by the scale which are layered in different pattern on top of each other in fact each scale ha multiple layer which are separated by air so when light hit them it reflected many time and the combination of these reflection cause u to see the intense yellow and blue of many butterfly specie some butterfly even reflect ultraviolet light which is unable to be seen by human the ability of monarch butterfly to detect ultraviolet light help them on their annual migration from north america to mexico for example mr gledhill said ive always taken macro photograph of insect moth and butterfly i have a lifelong interest in exploring the world beyond what the unaided human eye can see this led me to use research quality microscope and combining the two skill he us a trinocularreflecting light microscope fitted with neo splan objective or attachment and take the photograph using a canon eos d mark ii which is fitted to the top of the microscope the microscope ha also been modified by adding a stackshot stepping motor and controller to drive the focusing control meaning very small step can be made in the focusing stage mr gledhill said ive always taken macro photograph of insect moth and butterfly i have a lifelong interest in exploring the world beyond what the unaided human eye can see this closeup image show scale on the wing of the monarch butterfly mr gledhill imaged the madagascan sunset moth wing in minute detail the moth pictured left fly during the day and is considered one of the most impressive and appealinglooking lepidopteran he also captured the wing of the monarch butterfly stock image shown right which is the most familiar north american butterfly specie he us a trinocularreflecting light microscope fitted with neo splan objective or attachment and take the photograph using a canon eos d mark ii this camera is fitted to the top of the microscope overlapping pale blue scale are pictured the depth of field in a single microscope image is too small to see the whole of the butterfly in one image so mr gledhill take up to separate image spaced by one micron interval to capture the creature these image are then combined into a single imaging using focus stacking software resulting in picture that are sharp and in full focus the picture are stunningly beautiful and they make me realise how lucky i am to be able to capture the intricate structure of butterfly mr gledhill continued often people think they are fabric and appear very surprised when they find out they are the scale which look like dust which they remember experiencing when they touched a butterfly a a child the depth of field in a single microscope image is too small to see the whole of the butterfly in one image so mr gledhill take up to separate image spaced by one micron interval to capture the creature before carefully combining the shot this image show the wing of salami parhassus known a the forest mother of pearl a butterfly that life in forest in africa\n",

            "cnnon thursday npr headquartered in washington just mile away from baltimore ran it latest update on the urban turmoil that ha erupted in the wake of the death of yearold freddie gray because of stillunexplained spinal injury that occurred while he wa under police custody unfortunately while it wa a freshly produced segment it wa hardly a new story titled baltimore unrest reveals tension between africanamericans and asian the fiveminute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal whats really happening in the more troubled neighborhood of this majority black city going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest wa africanamericans targeting asianowned business for destruction a similar claim wa made after fergusons uprising in august of last year indeed it ha been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episode of mass metropolitan violence since the late s the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between asian and black community first took root in the medium consciousness yes interethnic tension continue to exist though they are hardly limited to asian and black and yes this ha resulted in troubling incident and tragedy on both side but while report say that during the chaotic social breakdown of the past year blackowned business were mostly protected during bout of violence there little evidence to suggest a pattern in which asian business have been actively targeted out of racial animus instead it seems a if asianowned store have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishment operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhood in other word they were collateral damage along with other store in the vicinity of riot so it time to call this persistent meme what it is a misleading hyperbolic and dangerous distraction one that shift blame away from the real issue a jennifer lee sociology professor at university of california irvine and author of the book civility in the city black jew and korean in urban america note the mainstream medium continues to pit minority group against one another to draw attention from larger structural problem that plague poor disadvantaged community by directing our attention to interminority conflict it directs blame away from the structure that perpetuate gross inequality and toward individual problem let be honest there were then and still are legitimate issue that exist between immigrant storeowners and the largely african american customer they serve that are rooted in extensive cultural difference there no denying that friction exists in the daily transaction between embattled community trying hard to coexist under economic and social pressure for example in the robbery and shooting of joel lee a yearold korean american at towson state university and the subsequent acquittal of his killer wa a point of contention between the korean and african american community but thing are different now decade after the height of mediainflamed tension between asian and african american pattern of immigration have shifted store once operated by recent korean immigrant are now owned by striver from south asia the middle east and africa the population of baltimore ha shrunk and it economy ha contracted among merchant there evergreater recognition that they and their customer are tied by a red thread surviving or failing together for decade black and asian advocacy group have been trying to bridge difference between the community for example the baltimorebased koreanamerican grocer licensed beverage association of maryland founded in ha worked to support it entrepreneurial member in their own attempt to address longstanding issue of neglect and abuse by baltimore police while also encouraging them to build deeper tie with their constituent a kagrosponsored annual scholarship program ha given hundred of thousand of dollar in college grant to child growing up in the baltimore neighborhood their member retailer serve these arent the kind of story youll hear in the medium it easier to focus on attentiongrabbing anecdote rather than the long hard work of adjustment and accommodation going on within and around community back in the baltimore sun profiled soon jae and eun ja lee owner of lee food market in the west baltimore sandtown neighborhood the same part of the city that npr called out a a locus of asianblack tension the story highlighted the lee openness to the community their politeness and care for their customer and their outstanding generosity which includes both free snack to schoolchildren and the distribution of ten of thousand of free food basket to needy local family each year i spoke with eun ja lee calling her without warning to check on the status of the lee fourdecadeold business after the violence of monday and tuesday were they open were they safe oh of course were open were always open said mr lee warmly and brightly this week many customer came in and said to me mr lee dont worry you are part of our community you are our family we will make sure you are ok just stay open we love it we love it and yet no one ha come and interviewed her at their untouched and fully operational family market nor have they talked with her customer stoutly loyal after year of patronage reinforcing the tired narrative of blackasian interracial tension generates heat but not light there a far more complex and nuanced relationship between these two urban population one that is in an ongoing state of evolution and it deserves to be

capital kathmandu to discus how the area would cope with such disaster resting on colliding tectonic plate nepal is under constant threat of earthquake of natural disaster but expert claim it shoddy infrastructure and poor building standard make the country much le equipped to deal with the aftermath of major incident scroll down for video the united state geological survey said the quake struck kilometre mile northwest of kathmandu at gmt with wall crumbling and family racing outside of their home on sunday evening the death toll had crept up to people across four country with hundred still missing speaking of the nepalese capital where the scientific meeting wa held one expert said it the devastation wa an accident waiting to happen physically and geologically what happened is exactly what we thought would happen said seismologist james jackson head of the earth science department at the cambridge university i wa walking through that very area where that earthquake wa and i thought at the very time that the area wa heading for trouble said mr jackson lead scientist for earthquake without frontier a group that try to help asian city prepare for disaster local rescued two more dustcovered men pulling them up on the the street a they work to find and rescue any survivor of the disaster earthquake of similar magnitude can have bigger effect on different part of the globe because of the manner of building construction and population density a magnitude earthquake could kill to per one million resident in california but ha killed at least in nepal and could kill up to in part of pakistan india iran and china said u geological survey seismologist david wald with the death toll steadily creeping up to on sunday evening the full extent of the horror brought by the earthquake is slowly unfolding a rescuer scramble to save stranded climber on mount everest where died under avalanche yesterday expert are warning the worst of the disaster is to come aftershock rocked the himalayan country this morning with resident describing the tremor in terrifying detail one registered on the richter scale and is feared to have triggered yet more avalanche on everest while the original earthquake magnitude labelled it a major incident it struck just km underground making it effect all the more devastating coupled with that is it lack of preparation for such destructive tremor a relatively poor country it building are shoddily constructed and easily torn down expert also fear the earthquake shallowness could have sparked landslide across the mountainous region this is the fifth significant earthquake in nepal in the last year including a massive one in that levelled the city they knew they had a problem but it wa so large they didnt where to start how to start said hari ghi south east asia regional coordinator for geohazards international a group that calculates worldwide quake risk nepal wa making progress on reducing it vulnerability to earthquake but not quickly or big enough mr ghis group on april updated a late s report summarising the kathmandu valley risk with an annual population growth rate of per cent and one of the highest urban density in the world the million people living in the kathmandu valley were clearly facing a serious and growing earthquake risk the report said laying out the problem the valley face it wa also clear that the next large earthquake to strike near the valley would cause significantly greater loss of life structural damage and economic hardship than past earthquake had inflicted and for year there were no building code and rampant development so home and other structure could be built without any regard to earthquake the report said there are now building code but that doesnt help the older structure and the code arent overly strong mr ghi said it actually even made worse because of local inheritance law that require property be split equally among all son mr jackson said so that mean building are split vertically among brother making very thin rickety home that need more space so people add insecure living space on additional floor he said the construction is appalling in kathmandu he said poverty and pollution make the problem worse thats because people dont spend time worrying about some future earthquake because they have more pressing problem if you live in the kathmandu valley you have other priority daily threat and daily nasty thing happen to you in term of air quality water quality pollution traffic and just poverty mr jackson said but it doesnt mean that the earthquake go away nepalese rescue team remove a body from the rubble of the historic th century darahara tower in kathmandu which collapsed in the quake people search for survivor in the

            "to hear leigh griffith tell it the intervention staged by celtic bos ronny deila and assistant john collins wa definitely closer to a kick in the whatnot than it wa a pat on the back whatever the detail of the conversation and however lasting the effect may be the shortterm impact on the yearold force of nature often a unruly and unpredictable a a whirlwind ha been nothing short of remarkable a the kid himself put it being top scorer now mean that since i have had a talk with the manager i have knuckled down and proved him wrong proved jc wrong and shown that i deserve to be here hattrick hero leigh griffith with signed match ball and man of the match award rather revealing isnt it clearly demanding deila and original gym rat collins did not hold back in dealing with the gifted but wild natural talent wielding a big stick in a bid to persuade griffith that the carrot wasnt such a bad alternative to chip and tea cake i had to improve admits the former hibs star i wasnt playing at the start of the season i had a talk with the manager and john collins about everything and about what they wanted me to do thankfully in the two month since the turn of the year i have knuckled down and they are seeing the reward now what did they say to me i had to be working hard in the gym and working hard to get my fitness level up i did that and i have been bang on form since the turn of the year when i wa at hibs i would have been the first name on the team sheet given the goal i scored but coming here it a massive club and with the new manager coming into the club he wanted to impose his own philosophy playing one up front you have to work hard and my fitness level were not up to his standard since january though my fitness level have been good and i have been scoring goal i wa brought to celtic to score goal and ive started to do that since the turn of the year i havent set any new target but i do want a good run of game i want to be starting every game from now until the end of the season and score a many goal a i possibly can celtic leigh griffith right completes his hattrick against kilmarnock the manager selects the team he think is best to win the game and we have boy in the squad and coming on from the bench myself anthony stokes stuart armstrong gary mackaysteven were all on the bench against kilmarnock griffith is making a stronger case than most by banging in the goal his hattrick in wednesday night home win over kilmarnock definitely ranking among the better substitute performance the scottish game ha seen this season his second treble haul in celtic colour took his total for the season to goal the majority of those coming in a he ha contended more frequently with john guidetti stefan scepovic and anthony stokes for the lone striker role favoured for now at least by deila watching guidetti amble around aimlessly until griffith arrived to partner the big swede on wednesday night it definitely seems a though deila ha only two option for sunday scottish cup semifinal against inverness either he play both in a traditional frontpairing or he let griffith scorer of an early opener against caley thistle in the highland last weekend loose on his own at hampden if his midweek goal explosion make it impossible to omit the former livingston dundee and wolf striker from the starting xi his record in major semifinal at the national stadium also count in his favour substitute griffith came off the bench to spark celtic into life after lacklustre firsthalf the extratime hero a he scored his second of the game to ease hibs past falkirk at this stage of the scottish cup two year ago griffith also opened the scoring for celtic against ranger in the league cup semi earlier this season ive played in two semifinal at hampden and i have won two he point out hopefully i can continue that ill be looking to score again but the most important thing is for the team to win the game and reach the scottish cup final inverness will come down and make it difficult for u they proved last weekend they are a hard team to beat every game against them this season ha been tight and i expect the same again on sunday if griffith start and play a he did against killie even caley thistle at their most obdurate will struggle to cope his hattrick one perfectly placed header one absolute screamer from distance and a driven low finish wa a timely reminder of what he can do when the mood is upon him celtic manager ronny deila left congratulates griffith after the final whistle it wasnt a bad night work he say with a smile it wa just good to get the win because we were disappointed not to win at inverness last weekend and we had suffered a setback going down to kilmarnock although the boy fought back in the right way all of the goal were my favourite the first one wa a great ball into the box by kris common and i managed to head it down into the net the second one went in off the post and i wa just waiting for the whistle to go for being offside for the third thankfully it didnt come and i fired it back across the goalkeeper it only my third hattrick in senior football so it decent my second one came for celtic against inverness last year cute move dropping that into conversation take note gaffer not only am i bang in form not only do i have a great record at hampden but ive shown i can do the business against inverness celtic start a favourite on sunday and with hibs also edging the odds in their semi against falkirk griffith could spend may torn between professional pride and genuine love for his hometown team asked outright if he would like to face hibernian balancing up the desire to become a treble winner against the need to condemn his boyhood hero to at least one more year of scottish cup taunt griffith admitted honest answer no if they get there it will be great for the club but im just concentrating on doing my job for celtic we are eight point clear in the league and in a good position and obviously we want to go for the treble there is still a long way to go and we have difficult game coming up at the moment inverness are standing in our way of having a potentially great

past the scoreboard on the th hole following his sensational performance dustin johnson eye up a putt no the th green during his recordbreaking display on friday johnson started with a double bogey but positively pillaged the course scoreable par five to devastating effect he had eagle at the second and the th birdied the th before striking a wondrous blow to the th that pulled up inch from the

chorus line member charley hoffman two stroke nearer the lead following a creditable gutsy englishman justin rose and paul casey are on the same mark a johnson with the former weighing in with a fine

the th with a double at the th to turn in stroke it the sixth year in a row the northern irishman ha thrown in a horrific nine like this and until he address the problem he simply can not win a green jacket at least on the back nine he showed the pride of a current double major champion and the improvement he ha made mentally from the day when his shoulder used to slump one shot outside the projected halfway cut mark he birdied the th and then at the th the hole that ha given him so much trouble in the past he hit his second shot to ft for a tapin eagle three mcilroy missed from ft at

awesome demonstration of dominance the like of which we havent seen since another yearold named tiger walked away with the edition all this on the day another lone star legend ben crenshaw waved goodbye to the master it tempting to talk about a passing of the texas torch except spieth is destined for a level of greatness twice master champion crenshaw could only dream about think hogan rather than gentle ben rory mcilroy reacts to a poor second shot on the fifth hole in what wa a frustrating day for the world no paul casey try to clear out of a bunker on the eighth hole a for tiger his first round wa actually an awful lot better than his score and the review suggested it wa in fact the most encouraging sign weve seen for him for well over a year his short game wa back to it best and his task on friday wa to instil some rhythm in his long game that is exactly what happened the rare sight of him finding the first fairway wa encouraging and even better wa the laser iron that followed it finished ft away and the birdie putt found the middle of the hole for minute it wa like watching tiger at his best the rest of the round wa also heartening he reached the turn in to be one under for the event and inside the top justin rose flip his club into the air after the english golfer cleared a sand trap on the th green ben crenshaw closed out his master career with two mediocre

            "ed miliband vowed to end casual employment contract yesterday but his crackdown backfired spectacularly a he forgot labour use them ed miliband wa accused of hypocrisy last night after labour town hall and mp were revealed to be hiring thousand of worker on zerohours contract the labour leader yesterday vowed to end casual employment contract that undermine living standard and family life but his crackdown which wa intended to regain the political initiative after boost for the tory on job and income backfired spectacularly in a disastrous day for labour general election hope speaking in huddersfield mr miliband said a labour government would legislate to require employer to offer a contract to anyone who had been working regular hour for week he made a stinging attack on both david cameron and firm that use exploitative contract which fail to guarantee minimum hour of work scroll down for video the conservative believe by looking after a few big firm and individual at the top everyone else will be ok said mr miliband but far from being the preserve of business the contract are being routinely used by charity the public sector and the labour party itself it emerged that labour mp had also signed up researcher and other staff on zerohour contract in the last two year including shadow health secretary andy burnham right and shadow chancellor ed ball left freedom of information request circulated by the conservative reveal that labour council are behind zerohours contract in december last year the director of finance at doncaster council admitted to still having relief worker on their book among the worst authority are wolverhampton which had staff on zerohours contract a of may liverpool with a of september and ealing with a of january in an even greater embarrassment it emerged that labour mp had also signed up researcher and other staff on the deal over the past two year they included shadow health secretary andy burnham shadow chancellor ed ball mr milibands parliamentary bag carrier karen buck and his election supremo lucy powell the labour politician said they had been told by the parliamentary expense watchdog to use the contract in order to pay a living wage freedom of information request found zerohours contract were handed out by labourrun council including doncaster pictured where mr miliband is standing for mp tory chairman grant shapps said it the same old hypocrisy from ed miliband on the day he generates a load of hot air about zerohours contract it emerges that his party is one of the most prolific user of them it chaos in the labour party that would cause chaos for the country ed milibands not up to the job because he say one thing and doe another a hung parliament could send financial market into a tailspin and the pound and share crashing expert warned last night sterling ha already fallen nearly per cent against the u dollar in the past five week amid jitter about the outcome of the general election george buckley of deutsche bank said the general election is set to be the most unpredictable for nearly a century there may be no good outcome for investor david buik of stockbroker panmure gordon said market are incapable of dealing with uncertainty if you cant trust him on the basic you cant trust him to lead the country conservative candidate charlie elphicke added this is total hypocrisy from ed miliband labour did nothing about zerohours contract during it year in power and now we learn that labour mp and council use them routinely the spotlight wa also turned on a number of startling claim made by mr miliband yesterday whose speech worsened already bad relation with big business his suggestion that britain ha an epidemic of zero hour contract wa rubbished by official statistic from the ons the ons had explicitly warned the people who reported having a zerohours contract between october and december should not be compared with the in the previous year the uk official statistician said it is not possible to say how much of this increase is due to greater recognition of the term zerohours contract rather than new contract however mr miliband still made the claim the centrepiece of his headline grabbing announcement yesterday the organisation full fact said the labour leader claim were unjustified the tory say they have tightened the law to end abuse of zerohours employer can no longer insist on exclusivity deal which ban staff from working for other firm last week david cameron said he could not live on an exploitative zerohours contract labour mp karen buck left and mr milibands election supremo lucy powell right also use zerohours chancellor george osborne made similar comment last night saying of course it would be very difficult there are some zerohour contract that people want christian may of the institute of director said labour plan go too far matthew irvine associate at the law firm thomas eggar said to many this will seem an eyecatching and attractive policy with miliband championing worker right over capitalist employer who are putting profit above worker welfare the risk however is that this proposal go too far and would endanger the continued economic recovery in reality employer may well choose to dismiss worker before they reach week or be reluctant to offer work in the first place milibands proposal would potentially undermine job creation jeopardise zerohours worker current job and increase their insecurity yesterday opening up yet another front in his war on business ed miliband pledged a labour government would end the exploitation of zerohours contract here james slack sort the labour leader emotive claim about the contract from the very different reality claim we have an epidemic of zerohours contract in our country reality according to the office for national statistic between october and december last year a total of people said they were employed on zerohours contract in their main job this represents only per cent of people in employment or one in every worker this hardly constitutes an epidemic claim there ha been a per cent increase in the last year alone reality it is true the number of people reporting they were on a zerohours contract rose by in the year to december but the ons say the two set of figure are not comparable in some case they will have been on the contract for year but only just become aware of the fact because miliband had spent so much time talking about them labour wa warned by statistician not to use the figure but carried on regardless claim zerohours contract undermine hard work undermining living standard undermining family life reality far from inflicting untold misery on the majority of worker by making it impossible for them to make end meet per cent said they did not want to work more hour only one in ten on zerohours contract said they would like a different job the average number of hour worked wa per week almost one in five were in fulltime education which would make it hard for them to work any more hour even if they wished to claim the tory wont end the exploitation of zerohours contract we will reality last june the conservativeled government took action to ban socalled exclusivity deal which prevented people on zerohours contract from working elsewhere labour record by contrast is nothing to boast about tony blair promised in to ban them after it emerged they were used in uk fast food chain but his government failed to act in three term in power claim if it not good enough for u it not good enough for you one rule for all reality mr miliband said he could not survive on one of the contract but plenty employed by labour council and official have to do so some labour mp are reported to have employed staff on the contract over the last two year including ed ball mr milibands parliamentary bag carrier karen buck and his election chief lucy powell meanwhile freedom of information request show labourrun town hall are responsible for of the contract including in doncaster where the labour leader is seeking reelection a the local mp claim the conservative believe by looking after a few big firm and individual at the top everyone else will be ok reality it by no mean only big business that appreciates the flexibility the contract can provide a survey of employer by the chartered institute of personnel and development found that a third of voluntary sector organisation used zerohours contract along with a quarter of public sector employer the figure for private firm once again the target for an attack by mr miliband wa only per cent p even the evermeddling eu doe not object to zerohours contract despite intense lobbying by labour meps and the party trade union paymaster brussels ha opted to stay out of the row it insists only that worker should not work more hour than permitted by the working time directive and should be entitled to any holiday right they have accrued\n",

nine game after a run of six defeat in their previous eight why even when west ham were a abject a they were until city lost silva to serious injury they have been unable to play with such confidence more frequently sergio aguero slotted manchester city into a two goal lead after a fine flowing counter attack by the home side against west ham the argentine striker sprint away in celebration having

strengthens city position among the champion league place on a weekend when manchester united lost eas the pressure on manuel pellegrini but there is sure to remain a fair amount of frustration in abu

accidental elbow in the face from cheikhou kouyate midway through the second half the spanish international required oxygen before leaving the pitch on a stretcher after eight minute of treatment he wa then taken to hospital but other problem nevertheless remain for city manager pellegrini when he had to wake to headline being generated by the notoriously vocal agent of toure who reportedly accused the chilean of being a weak manager a well a criticising other prominent member of the club hierarchy too pellegrini wa asked to respond but declined to comment with manager such a jurgen

length to show that check donald sterling drew from his real estate business ended up in account that financed most of stivianos million spanishstyle duplex near beverly hill while an accountant for sterling conservatively estimated that stiviano got more than million in sterling gift that included a ferrari and paris shopping spree odonnell said he would only seek return of the house and more than million in cash saying the lower figure lined up with stivianos own admission on the witness stand deposition and court filing v stiviano pictured arriving at los angeles superior court last

that there wa no clear documentation that fund went from the sterling family real estate company to stivianos bank account defense lawyer mac nehoray reiterated that point in his closing argument he attacked the credibility of witness particularly donald sterling who had suggested stiviano got her name on the home title illegally it wa stiviano who recorded the nowinfamous conversation with donald sterling in which he berated her for associating with black people and urged her not to bring minority with her to clipper basketball game in the furor sparked when the remark were made public the nba banned sterling from the league for life and he wa ultimately forced to sell the clipper franchise he had owned for year for a record billion nehoray spent most of his argument trying to

stated under oath that her relationship with the clipper owner nearly five decade her senior wa spiritual in nature stiviano never not disputed donald sterling largesse though she quibbled with the sum at stake and emphatically denied that she used sex to manipulate him she repeatedly testified that sterling tried to manipulate her the apparent contradiction finally led shelly sterling lawyer pierce odonnell to confront stiviano with the question who is the real donald sterling the real donald sterling is a con artist a bigot he mean he despicable stiviano replied before quickly adding that to her he wa kind loving sweet a mentor a father he treated me a he treated no one else she added that tolerating his racist moment wa part of the job that had it reward in the way he treated her and her family stiviano broke down in tear a she described the clipper owner showing up at the hospital when her brother needed a heart transplant and described how he appeared in court to support her adoption of two boy in her testimony miss stiviano claimed that she wa not the only recipient of cash gift from her octogenarian benefactor and she named a male friend of sterling who accompanied them on trip to dubai paris and thailand shelly sterling said outside court that the assertion wa crazy and she described the man a a longtime family friend who despises stiviano the judge allowed the testimony a stivianos lawyer tried to show where large unexplained check may have gone from sterling real estate company that his wife claim were used to pay for a million duplex luxury car jewelry

apple can a doctor not afford an apartment the show wa a breakthrough for onscreen representation the first network sitcom created by and starring a woman of color and it look likely to be renewed for the coming season recently however kalings brother vijay chokalingam unveiled a project of his own and while it ha been getting a lot of attention it hasnt generated quite a many laugh either from observer or from his famous sibling who told him it brought shame upon their family you see chokalingam revealed that a an undergraduate at the university of chicago he engaged in a daring his view or ridiculous and offensive pretty much everyone else scam he applied to medical school claiming to be africanamerican chokalingam had spent his college year a a hardpartying frat boy and achieved a le than stunning gpa upon facing graduation and exploring his med school option he realized that fellow indianamericans with his grade were getting turned down from the university of his choice but that black hispanic and native american applicant with my grade and test score were much more likely to gain acceptance this revelation led him to make the decision to pose a a black man both to dramatically improve his chance of admission and to illustrate the unfair advantage that black and other underrepresented minority receive when applying to prestigious school to accomplish this goal chokalingam shaved his head of it naturally wavy black lock trimmed his long indianamerican eyelash checked black under the optional raceethnicity declaration and submitted his application to school under his childhood nickname jojo he received invitation for inperson interview at school result that he claim support the notion that africanamericans garner special privilege that are unavailable to white or asian and now that the statute of limitation on his act of fraud ha expired he looking to write a book on his experience titled almost black the true story of an indian american who got into medical school pretending to be an african american whats truly curious is that even if you agree with chokalingam that affirmative action is merely a form of systematic racism when all is said and done it offer very little evidence of the privilege that he claim is accorded to black hispanic and native american candidate chokalingam had mediocre grade and mcats but he graduated from one of the most prestigious school in the nation yet even while representing himself a black chokalingam received only a single admission offer to st louis university school of medicine which fall somewhere between th and th in national ranking harvard university of pennsylvania columbia and all the higher ranked school he applied to rejected him meanwhile he admits pretending to be black came with disadvantage he found himself being accused of shoplifting by store clerk and harassed by cop who would regularly stop him while driving and demand that he tell them how much his car cost implying that he must have stolen it these act of very real prejudice experienced regularly by black and hispanic of all background multimillionaire comedian chris rock ha recently been tweeting picture of the occasion when he is pulled over by police for no reason didnt seem to dissuade chokalingam from his adamant belief in the unfairness of a system that seek to address the shockingly low number of minority health practitioner by providing some weight to race and ethnicity in decisionmaking it not just a matter of what individual applicant deserve onethird of american are black hispanic or native american just one in physician are since minority medical practitioner are up to three time a likely to practice in their own community this lack of diversity ha produced doctor desert in which urban and rural ethnic enclave across the nation go without access to primary care physician year ago when i told my father a doctor from a long line of doctor that i didnt want to follow in his footstep he told me that wa fine because medicine is a service trade and anyone not interested in serving should avoid the profession a medical degree isnt a reward to be earned he said but a responsibility to be accepted which really cut to the heart of whats so sad about chokalingams racial farce like others whove recently been exposed for falsely claiming racial identity including putative presidential candidate jeb bush who registered himself a hispanic on a voter form and massachusetts sen elizabeth warren who wa excoriated during her campaign for having claimed native american ancestry in the past chokalingam wanted to claim the fruit of racial affiliation without having to carry black people burden race isnt just about color or blood it is about the collective experience and inherited cultural context and presentday condition of a community of people many of the marker of race are persistently corrosive others are deeply painful affirmative action program are a mean of redress for these awful reality of our nation history an imperfect one but necessary there are some field where the imbalance might never correct themselves on their own industry like health care and hollywood because whats most ironic about chokalingams decision to ride on his sister coattail in telling his story while asian are well represented in medicine our number are vanishingly low in the entertainment and medium world and until the recent breakthrough of modern pioneer like mindy kaling it wa impossible to imagine film and television that included our face voice and story kalings immense talent and charisma made her a star but it wa a quotabased affirmative action initiative nbcs diversity writer program that gave her a start\n",

have been together for year and bought their home in the quiet lincolnshire seaside resort of mablethorpe for in they spent two year converting it into their dream home but it became a living hell after it wa converted into an integrated offender management centre which deal with persistent criminal scroll down for video board stiff the couple have been forced to board up every window in their home for protection the pair have both suffered health problem a a result of the stress the ordeal ha put them under mr kingham who served in the merchant navy and ran his own timber company before retiring said the biggest fear for me is going to bed and wondering if we are going to wake up if something is thrown through the letter box we sit here sometimes and think how we have had such a wonderful life but this is misery absolute misery and nobody want to do anything that is the modern world m moore claimed the problem started when people started selling drug nearby and would walk up their garden path high incident intensified when the couple reported antisocial behaviour in the area they were targeted on an almost weekly basis with vandal smashing window with stone and pelting their home with egg and golf ball the thug even splashed cooking fat across the wall and path urinated on their flower and keyed their car at least they have each other the couple have been together for year despite misery caused by thug every single window of their home ha been smashed and the couple eventually got so sick of having to spend time and money replacing them that they took drastic measure the pair spent on wood and boarded up the house for protection they have been living in the shadow ever since and although the house should be worth the couple believe they would have to sell for a knockdown price of to escape the darkness retired office worker m moore sobbed this house wa a dream home but our life ha been made a living hell we cant sell and are just stuck here so weve barricaded ourselves in it the only thing we could think of doing to stop the abuse we have both got so low i have developed a heart condition through anxiety when they were banging on the window charles went down with a chest infection because of the stress i thought he wa going to die dark day mr kingham ha to perform normal daily task in constant gloom since boarding up his home the trouble started four year ago when the old lady who lived next door died and the house wa turned into an integrated offender management centre it wa basically for offender coming out of prison we didnt have a problem with that at first but suddenly people in the area started selling drug and coming up our garden path high and even urinating on it we reported it to the police and ever since then we have been plagued with problem the police have been down and seen the damage caused weve had a pan of chip fat put on the wall of the house and we had our little red ford fiesta completely keyed down both side keen reader mr kingham left ha been forced to read in a dark room since they boarded up the window right in november there wa a big party nearby and at am people were banging on our window and shouting weve had egg and golf ball thrown at our bungalow and three of our window are still chipped we didnt report every incident to the police because we thought wed just sell up and we hoped it would all stop but it ha just got worse we decided enough wa enough and got the window boarded up because it the only thing we could think of to do to protect ourselves we have boarded up the two window in the lounge the two in the bedroom and the kitchen the only one that arent boarded are the dining room and bathroom it is quite dark inside and not nice sitting in total darkness when the weather is lovely but it wa the only alternative and we do feel safer better day the couple enjoying life on a holiday to the usa in the s before the problem started we could sell our bungalow which is not what we want to do by law you have to declare antisocial behaviour so even though it is worth we would probably only be able to sell it for mr kingham added we are compiling a full report of incident against our home but i fear it wont make much difference boarding the window seemed the most common sense thing to do lincolnshire police and east lindsey district council confirmed they were aware of the attack on the couple home jon challen community safety team leader at east lindsey district council said both the council and police take all report of antisocial behaviour very seriously both agency are working closely together on this matter but at this time there is no evidence that any offence ha been committed a spokesperson for lincolnshire police added the local neighbourhood policing team are aware of the couple and the allegation of antisocial behaviour lincolnshire police take all report of asb seriously and together with partner at other agency have robust system in place to assist those affected and identify the most vulnerable to date in this case no offence have been identified but police and asb officer from east lindsey district council continue to offer

supply the russian in order to free up a new line of attack on the german it would also pull in the greek and bulgarian ancient enemy of the ottoman turk and hey presto the stalemate of the western front would be suddenly transformed into a glorious victory from the east churchill who wa first lord of the admiralty had underestimated the strength of the turkish troop under the command of modern turkey founding father kemal atatrk and had overestimated the potency of his own superannuated fleet which fell easy prey to the mine and coastal gun battery churchill left had been a soldier but in underestimated the turkish force led by atatrk right if the naval thrust wa a failure his attempt to consolidate on land wa a calamity and after nine month of blistering summer heat and frostbitten

bottle with a firebreathing demon on it it taste like big red chewing gum it fireball cinnamon whisky and lately it been a hot a it name fireball is number one definitely thats pretty much the chosen shot said belue who enjoys it herself now and then on an average night we probably go through three or four bottle if youre young say under this may not be news to you fireball which didnt exist in it current form a decade ago is the fastestgrowing big brand of liquor in america retail sale more than doubled last year and fireball ha come seemingly out of nowhere to become the sixthmost popular liquor brand in the u a measured by retail sale ahead of such venerable label a jim beam jose cuervo and grey goose and these figure dont include sale in bar where fireball ha dethroned jagermeister a america party shot of choice or social medium feed which fill with photo of fireballflavored revelry and fireballfriday hashtags fireball is an incredible phenomenon the growth of it ha just been astounding said lew bryson managing editor of whisky advocate and author of several book on whiskey and other spirit for a whiskey this is unprecedented to the uninitiated fireball is basically made from canadian whisky aged in used bourbon barrel flavored with sweetener and spicy cinnamon the whisky spelling generally refers to scotch or canadian variety while whiskey refers to irish or american style it slogan is taste like heaven burn like hell but thats an exaggeration fireball ha a kick but it doesnt burn a much a straight whiskey cheap tequila or even the atomic fireball hard candy that helped inspire it name it also only proof or alcohol le than most whiskey it so easy to drink that you forget youre drinking alcohol it very sweet you hardly taste the whiskey at all said zachary jones a bartender at community smith in atlanta ive known people who cant do shot but they can do fireball fireball is especially popular among young drinker and woman many of whom say they like that it doesnt singe their throat and leaf a dentynelike aftertaste but not everyone is a fan whiskey enthusiast the type who can talk knowledgeably about singlemalt scotch mostly turn up their nose at the stuff ive got to be honest it not anything id reach for at any occasion bryson said but clearly im not in the mainstream fireball wasnt always fireball it used to be known a dr mcgillicuddys fireball whisky before it maker the sazerac co rebranded it in sale were modest until about five year ago when sazerac hired a national brand ambassador richard pome to spread the word about fireball through event planning and bartender outreach in other word pome traveled the country serving up fireball shot in bar he started in college town and city with vibrant bar culture such a austin and nashville and then spread to other place everywhere he went pome shared his fireballing exploit on facebook twitter and instagram and encouraged patron to do the same soon fireball started gaining traction then it exploded retail sale jumped from just under million in to million in to million last year according to iri a chicagobased market research firm along the way sazerac ha cultivated a partyhearty social ethos around fireball encouraging pic of shot with hashtags such a whiskywednesday the brand ha more than follower on twitter and another on instagram more than twice the social reach of jagermeister although on twitter it still trail jack daniel whiskey and patron tequila and it got a boost in october when someone taped a gopro camera to a large bottle of the liquor and filmed dozen of guest chugging from it at a wedding reception the resulting video ha more than million youtube view our fan love it and they spread the word the fireball nation is devoted and this is the best kind of marketing said amy preske public relation and event manager for sazerac who declined to offer any further explanation for the brand booming popularity we are very excited and humbled so is fireball a future cornerstone of every wellstocked bar or just a fad it may be too soon to say retail sale remain strong according to iri although fireball skyrocketing growth ha slowed in recent month but it under siege from several front the past year ha brought copycat jim beam kentucky fire and jack daniel tennessee fire both bourbon whiskey infused with spicy cinnamon syrup along with cinnamon vodka cinnamon tequila and other cinnamon liqueur fireball also endured a publicrelations mess last fall when several european country briefly recalled the liquor over concern about one of it ingredient propylene glycol a chemical used in a variety of food product ecigarettes and antifreeze sazerac responded that propylene glycol exists in fireball in very small quantity le than th of the amount allowed by the fda pdf and reassured customer that fireball is absolutely safe to drink then there the question of whether fireball will become a victim of it own success young consumer are notoriously fickle and there is anecdotal evidence that some people are getting sick of it it just reached a point where i couldnt drink it anymore said jones the atlanta bartender i think it wa the sugar still it popularity remains on display nightly wherever young people gather glass are raised someone make a toast and down go shot of an orange syrupy and seemingly unstoppable concoction it an easy shot you can drink a lot of them with fireball you dont need a chaser said kelvin davis a bartender at the nook in atlanta it the one thing i can throw out there and it never fails\n",

            "a small hot spot in the u southwest is responsible for producing the largest concentration of the greenhouse gas methane seen over the united state and is the subject of a major new investigation to find out why the hot spot near the four corner intersection of arizona colorado new mexico and utah cover only about square mile square kilometer or half the size of connecticut a recent nasa map show is produce more than triple the standard groundbased estimate and researcher say they dont know why scroll down for video the four corner area red is the major u hot spot for methane emission in this map showing how much emission varied from average background concentration from dark color are lower than average lighter color are higher the hot spot near the four corner intersection of arizona colorado new mexico and utah cover only about square mile methane is very efficient at trapping heat in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide it contributes to global warming to calculate the emission rate that would be required to produce the observed concentration of methane in the air the author performed highresolution regional simulation using a chemical transport model which simulates how weather move and change airborne chemical compound researcher from several institution are now in the four corner region of the u southwest with a suite of airborne and groundbased instrument aiming to uncover reason for a mysterious methane hot spot detected from space with all the groundbased and airborne resource that the different group are bringing to the region we have the unique chance to unequivocally solve the four corner mystery said christian frankenberg a scientist at nasa jet propulsion laboratory pasadena california who is heading nasa part of the effort other investigator are from the cooperative institute for research in environmental science cires in boulder colorado the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and the university of michigan ann arbor last fall researcher including frankenberg reported that a small region around the four corner intersection of arizona colorado new mexico and utah had the highest concentration of methane over background level of any part of the united state an instrument on a european space agency satellite measuring greenhouse gas showed a persistent atmospheric hot spot in the area between and the amount of methane observed by the satellite wa much higher than previously estimated the satellite observation were not detailed enough to reveal the actual source of the methane in the four corner likely candidate include venting from oil and gas activity which are primarily coalbed methane exploration and extraction in this region active coal mine and natural gas seeps researcher from cires noaa earth system research laboratory and michigan are conducting a field campaign called topdown twin otter project defining oil well and natural gas emission bringing airborne and groundbased instrument to investigate possible source of the methane hot spot shiprock new mexico is in the four corner region where an atmospheric methane hot spot can be seen from space researcher are currently in the area trying to uncover the reason for the hot spot the jpl team will join the effort on april and fly two complementary remote sensing instrument on two twin otter research aircraft the nextgeneration airborne visibleinfrared imaging spectrometer avirisng which observes spectrum of reflected sunlight fly at a higher altitude and will be used to map methane at fine resolution over the entire region using this information and ground measurement from the other research team the hyperspectral thermal emission spectrometer hytes will fly over suspected methane source making additional highly sensitive measurement of methane depending on it flight altitude the nasa aircraft can image methane feature with a spatial resolution better than three foot one meter square in other word it can create a mosaic showing how methane level vary every few foot enabling the identification of individual source hotspot of total column methane anomaly centered over the four corner region from to when a satellitebased methanemeasuring instrument wa operational the april study will focus on verifying the hotspot and determining the methane source producing the exceptionally elevated methane concentration with the combined resource the investigator hope to quantify the region overall methane emission and pinpoint contribution from different source they will track change over the course of the monthlong effort and study how meteorology transport emission through the region if we can verify the methane detected by the satellite and identify it source decisionmakers will have critical information for any action they are considering said cires scientist gabrielle ptron one of the mission investigator part of president obamas recent climate action plan call for reduction in methane emission the research team also includes scientist from the institute of arctic and alpine research at the university of colorado boulder the u bureau of land management and the state of new mexico is this the cause the four corner coalfired power plant near farmington is one of the target nasa want to investigate a a possible cause of the methane in each of the seven year studied from the area released about million metric ton of methane into the atmosphere this is almost time the estimate for the same area in the european union widely used emission database for global atmospheric research in the study published online today in the journal geophysical research letter researcher used observation made by the european space agency scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric chartography sciamachy instrument which measured greenhouse gas from to the atmospheric hot spot persisted throughout the study period a ground station in the total carbon column observing network operated by the department of energy los alamo national laboratory provided independent validation of the measurement to calculate the emission rate that would be required to produce the observed concentration of methane in the air the author performed highresolution regional simulation using a chemical transport model which simulates how weather move and change airborne chemical compound research scientist christian frankenberg of nasa jet propulsion laboratory jpl in pasadena california first noticed the four corner signal year ago in sciamachy data we didnt focus on it because we werent sure if it wa a true signal or an instrument error frankenberg said the study lead author eric kort of the university of michigan ann arbor noted the study period predates the widespread use of hydraulic fracturing known a fracking near the hot spot this indicates the methane emission should not be attributed to fracking but instead to leak in natural gas production and processing equipment in new mexico san juan basin which is the most active coalbed methane production area in the country natural gas is percent methane methane is colorless and odorless making leak hard to detect without scientific instrument the result are indicative that emission from established fossil fuel harvesting technique are greater than inventoried kort said there been so much attention on highvolume hydraulic fracturing but we need to consider the industry a a whole in just one place in the united state do four state meet the border of utah colorado new mexico and arizona intersect at four corner west of the confluence of the mancos and san juan river coalbed methane is gas that line pore and crack within coal in underground coal mine it is a deadly hazard that cause fatal explosion almost every year a it seeps out of the rock after the u energy crisis of the s technique were invented to extract the methane from the coal and use it for fuel by coalbed methane supplied about percent of all natural gas in the united state frankenberg noted that the study demonstrates the unique role spacebased measurement can play in monitoring greenhouse gas satellite data can not be a accurate a groundbased estimate but from space there are no hiding place frankenberg said in march the obama administration announced a strategy to reduce methane emission under it climate action plan the strategy includes improving the measurement and monitoring of methane emission and assessing current methane emission data\n",

since campaigning group getup launched the gender price gap website last week member and everyday consumer have identified nine separate product that have identical female version which cost more bond ha been identified a one of the main culprit advertising a buttonup shirt that come in both summer blue and blue denim colour option on their australian website for getup new website the gender price gap ha exposed nine everyday item that cost more for woman this is despite the product being identical in almost every way except whether they are targeted towards woman or men however the exact same shirt advertised under the men clothing section is advertised for only other example highlighted on the website which show increase from a little a c or even c for item marketed towards female highlight the absurd and unexplained price difference even further while some might argue that they dont mind paying an additional few cent now and again getup senior campaigner kelsey cooke told daily mail australia that the cost accumulate significantly over a number of year i dont mind paying an extra cent for whatever item it might be that i like but when you think about it in term of weekly and yearly cost it hundred or even thousand of dollar more than my partner would be paying even if we had the same shopping list m cooke said other example highlighted on the website which show price increase by a little a c or even c for item marketed towards female highlight the absurd and unexplained price difference even further kinder surprise chocolate egg for instance which were advertised on cole website for have a pink packaged girl version for meanwhile a packet of five gillette disposable razor for woman wa photographed costing at a supermarket while the men version a packet of disposable identical in everything but colour cost the reason for the c price difference per razor remains a mystery when asked why company would charge woman more for the same item m cooke said there were two answer that getup had considered while some might argue that they dont mind paying an additional few cent now and again getup s senior campaigner kelsey cooke told daily mail australia that the cost accumulate significantly over the year a childrens mechanic set sold by the same company differs greatly in price but is there really a difference one is the idea that men product are thought of a the standard product the neutral or base product but the woman version is usually a special version or a side product it all come down to a theory being debated that woman are considered the other and different and thus it being ok to charge a premium for the product even if it no different she said the other reason is that theyre probably just able to get away with it im not privy to the conversation going on in these organisation so im not sure but i dare say that if they can find a way to make a profit on woman product by making them cost more then theyll probably

the country the party ha highly targeted strategy effectively fighting byelections in constituency where his candidate stand a chance a party source said if the party had a group of mp numbering in the s it could potentially hold the balance of power after may and be able to once again form part of a coalition government the senior lib dem closely involved in the party election strategy said the campaign focus wa increasingly on between and marginal seat some held by the party and a few target with other constituency either assessed a safe or effectively written off assessing the election outcome the source said everything is so marginal we need to get into the s and the other party need to sort themselves out and we will see what the answer is there are now basically two possible outcome to this election we can either get a minority government or a coalition with the lib dems in it asked if a seat count in the s wa realistic the source said oh yes pressed on whether that wa a best case scenario the senior lib dem said i would like to say but i think in fairness you wouldnt believe me there are lot of marginal seat there a marginal outcome in seat for u and if we won every one of those marginal contest we would get to odd mr clegg today admitted that his party wa fighting tooth and nail in fewer than a tenth of westminster seat opinion poll by yougov since show the dramatic collapse in the lib dem support to barely per cent the lib dems won seat in the election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the

formidable campaigner in byelection contest including in the hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet minister chris huhne despite a ukip surge mr clegg and the party election strategist have insisted the poor national opinion poll rating which have seen the party stuck around the per cent mark are not reflected in the data gathered by canvasser and internal polling the lib dem leader told supporter what we are going to do on may isnt just a the placard say win here we are going to win up and down the country because in effect what we are doing is running a campaign of not just one eastleigh byelection but eastleigh byelections north south east west campaigning with exactly the same vigour that led to that famous victory he added in the final week of this campaign two million voter will hear our message on facebook on youtube and on social medium so we are fighting a campaign like we have never fought a campaign before sixty byelections up and down the country mr clegg wa all smile at the ageas bowl cricket ground near eastleigh behind the scene senior party source admit their current total of mp will be slashed to in the thirty after a catastrophic collapse in support the alternative to a coalition involving the lib dems were a laboursnp alliance saddling our child with the dead weight of debt from this generation or a hapless david cameron administration dancing to the tune of ukip the dup and most chillingly and worryingly of all his own mp on the right wing of the conservative party in a rallying cry delivered at hampshire county cricket club ageas bowl stadium he said if you dont want to run the risk of our country lurching to the right lurching to the left the only way to guarantee to keep our country on

doe again we will speak to more voter than any other party again asked whether he wa now even running a national campaign following his call for eastleighs mr clegg said i am saying that exactly the same zeal of that byelection is what we are applying in the odd seat where we are fighting tooth and nail to get liberal democrat elected in this election a new survey by lord ashcroft had the tory on per cent with labour trailing on per cent ukip on per cent and the lib dems on per cent the tory could be six point ahead of labour or three point behind depending on which opinion poll to believe the latest batch of survey agree on only one thing the result is probably too close to call david camerons day will have been brightened by a sixpoint lead in a survey by lord ashcroft the tory are on per cent with labour trailing on per cent ukip on per cent and the lib dems on per cent another poll by icm for the guardian also gave mr camerons party a lead but of only three point lead on per cent to per cent for labour however the sun yougov poll had labour in the lead on per cent to the tory per cent indicating that the battle for no remains agonisingly close for the party leader labour enjoyed

            "woman have long been warned that the older they are the greater the risk of health problem for them and their baby but research now suggests older father can also affect baby health this increase the risk of epilepsy autism and breast cancer twothirds of new uk father are now over and the researcher say older wouldbe father should be better informed about the risk of condition that can occur in their offspring whereas the menopause mark the end of reproduction men are able to produce sperm throughout their life however the quality decline and according to the new research from doctor at the centre for reproductive medicine baylor college of medicine texas and other centre this could have implication for the next generation men are able to produce sperm throughout their life however the quality decline and this could have implication for the next generation worldwide data from more than team of researcher on the health risk associated with older father found that men aged over had a per cent lower chance of conceiving over a month period than men and under even after taking into account the age of the wouldbe mother the risk of miscarriage and premature birth also rise when the man is more than a study of pregnant woman analysed by the researcher found that pregnancy involving men aged or older were twice a likely to end in the loss of the foetus compared to younger father and the problem may not end with conception advanced paternal age over increase the risk of breast cancer in their daughter by around per cent according to one of the study the american researcher looked at one of five to find a link between advanced paternal age and breast cancer child conceived by father over also have a per cent increased risk of epilepsy a per cent higher risk of down syndrome a per cent greater chance of childhood leukaemia and a per cent greater likelihood of central nervous system cancer such a brain tumour if the father is over there is a threefold increased risk of retinoblastoma a rare type of eye cancer older father are thought to be at higher risk of having child with autism and schizophrenia if the father is over there is a threefold increased risk of retinoblastoma a rare type of eye cancer some of the biggest increase in risk are seen in genetic disorder achondroplasia a common cause of dwarfism is nearly eight time more prevalent in the child of father aged and over so why might this be in order to produce new sperm socalled sperm precursor cell have to divide they do this every day which mean by the time a man reach these cell will have divided around time with each division come a risk of dna mutation and genetic defect a study from iceland in found that the average child born to a yearold father ha dna mutation in their gene and that the number increase annually reaching mutation for offspring of yearold men increasing the risk of problem another explanation is that after the age of a high percentage of sperm is affected by socalled dna fragmentation normally the genetic material in a sperm cell is wound up like a tight ball of yarn to prevent the strand of dna breaking when the genetic material is not safely packaged the dna strand are vulnerable to breakage or dna fragmentation which mean the fertilised egg may not be able to develop normally and in some case become unviable with age a man testosterone level also drop with one in five men over having low level leading to poor semen quality which can affect conception rate advanced paternal age can also lead to birth defect say the baylor researcher whose study is being published in the journal fertility and sterility dr simon fishel chief executive of care fertility say even though men keep producing sperm the decline in sperm dna with age is now uncontroversial with potentially devastating effect on the offspring of older men it is not a marked or obvious an effect that we observe in woman which make it all the more insidious and risky for population in which men are reproducing later in life this study is telling u we need to sit up and take note and start to educate the public on the risk of the male biological clock and not just the female woman are generally counselled that a they reach their lates their risk of not just conceiving but of having a healthy child decrease a the quality and quantity of their egg deteriorate at a woman risk of conceiving a child with down syndrome is about one in but by age it is about one in yet currently patient are rarely warned about how advanced paternal age may present risk to their offspring but this should change say dr dolores lamb director of the centre for reproductive medicine and professor of urology and molecular and cellular biology at baylor college of medicine the medical community must do a better job of educating couple that there are some risk associated with conception at advanced paternal age she say one issue will be identifying the age at which problem may occur one study the researcher looked at which set out to find a cutoff age for men found that semen quality declined continuously with age with no point at which risk suddenly increased\n",

the nexss team includes those who study earth a a lifebearing planet lower right those researching the diversity of solar system planet left and those on the new frontier discovering world orbiting other star in the galaxy upper right the initiative dubbed nexus for exoplanet system science nexss will include scientist from university including stanford the university of california and yale the study of exoplanets is a relatively new field and began with the discovery of the first exoplanet around a star like our sun in since the launch of the kepler space telescope six year ago more than exoplanets have been found with thousand of additional candidate waiting to be confirmed nasa ha set up a website for the public called planet hunter which allows anyone to search the data gathered by kepler which launched six year ago scientist are also developing new way to confirm the habitability of these world and search for biosignatures or sign of life during a talk last month nasa said humanity will encounter extraterrestrial within a decade i believe we are going to have strong indication of life beyond earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next to year said ellen stofan chief scientist for nasa pictured at a washington panel discussion by applying a system science approach the team hope to understand an alien planet biology interacts with the atmosphere geology ocean and interior of a planet the announcement come just week after nasa top scientist predicted we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them during a talk in washington last month the space agency announced that humanity is likely to encounter extraterrestrial within a decade alien hunter from the university of berkeley california and stanford are tasked with answering the question what are the property of exoplanetary system a they relate to their formation evolution and potential to harbour life they will combine astronomical observation of exoplanets and forming planetary system with powerful computer simulation and cuttingedge microscopic study of meteorite the team from arizona state university in phoenix will take a similar approach this research group will place planetary habitability in a chemical context with the goal of producing a periodic table of planet researcher from hampton university virginia will be exploring the source and sink for volatile on habitable world this research will help determine the past and present habitability of mar and even venus the team centered at nasa goddard institute for space study will investigate habitability on a more local scale it will examine the habitability of solar system rocky planet through time the team from yale university in new haven connecticut will design new spectrometer optical instrument that measure the spectrum of light with the stability to reach earthdetecting precision for nearby star a group led the university of nebraskakearney will explore the existence and evolution of exosphere around exoplanets the outer unbound portion of a planet atmosphere from the university of california santa cruz a group will investigate how novel math equation can be used to extract information from light that is emitted and reflected by planetary atmosphere i believe we are going to have strong indication of life beyond earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next to year ellen stofan chief scientist for nasa said we know where to look we know how to look and in most case we have the technology jeffery newmark interim director of heliophysics at the agency added it definitely not an if it a when we are not talking about little green men stofan said we are talking about little microbe the announcement wa prompted by the recent discovery of water by nasa in surprising place jim green director of planetary science at nasa noted that a recent study of the martian atmosphere found per cent of the planet northern hemisphere once had ocean a mile deep scientist using the hubble recently provided powerful evidence that jupiter moon ganymede pictured ha a saltwater subsurface ocean likely sandwiched between two layer of ice the same study found that water had been present on the red planet for up to billion year we think that long period of time is necessary for life to get more complex stofan said nasa associate administrator john grunsfeld said he is excited about seeing what form life beyond earth may take in their hunt for alien life astronomer have so far focused on looking for earthlike planet around smaller cooler sun but these exoplanets despite having a chance of holding water are believed to be locked in a rotation around their sun which cause only one side of their surface face the star now astronomer claim that such exoplanets actually rotate around their star and spin at such a speed that they exhibit a daynight cycle similar to earth increasing the chance of finding alien life planet with potential ocean could have a climate that is much more similar to earth than previously expected said jrmy leconte a postdoctoral fellow at the canadian institute for theoretical astrophysics cita at the university of toronto if we are correct there is no permanent cold night side on exoplanets causing water to remain trapped in a gigantic ice sheet he said whether this new understanding of exoplanets climate increase the ability of these planet to develop life remains an open question once we get beyond mar which formed from the same stuff a earth the likelihood that life is similar to what we find on this planet is very low he said i think were one generation away in our solar system whether it on an icy moon or on mar and one generation away on a planet around a nearby star at the same conference last year nasa administrator charles bolden made a more conservative estimate he claimed that we will find life within the next year with a high chance it will be outside our solar system nasa next mar rover scheduled to launch in will search for sign of past life and bring sample for a possible return to earth for analysis nasa also hope to land astronaut on mar in the s which stofan say is crucial key to the search for mar life im a field geologist i go out and break open rock and look for fossil stofan said those are hard to find so i have a bias that it eventually going to take human on the surface of mar field geologist astrobiologists chemist actually out there looking for that good evidence of life that we can bring back to earth for all the scientist to argue about the space agency is also planning a mission to europa which may launch a early a it hope to find out whether the icy moon is habitable meanwhile the agency james webb space telescope jwst will launch in to

            "cnnrelations between iran and saudi arabia have always been thorny but rarely ha the state of affair been a venomous a it is today tehran and riyadh each point to the other a the main reason for much of the turmoil in the middle east in it most recent incarnation the iraniansaudi conflict by proxy ha reached yemen in a spiral that both side portray a climatic for riyadh and it regional ally the saudi military intervention in yemen operation decisive storm is the moment the sunni arab nation finally woke up to repel the expansion of shiairanian influence for tehran and it regional ally including the houthi movement in yemen saudi arabia action are in defense of a retrogressive status quo order that is no longer tenable and yet both side have good reason to want to stop the yemeni crisis from spiraling out of control and evolving into an unwinnable war when iranian president hassan rouhani wa elected in june he pledged to reach out to riyadh he wa up front and called tehran steep deterioration of relation with the saudi over the last decade a one of the principal burden on iranian foreign policy from lebanon and afghanistan to pakistan and the gaza strip the iraniansaudi rivalry and conflict through proxy ha been deep and costly and yet despite rouhanis open pledge profound difference over syria and iraq in particular have kept riyadh and tehran apart but if the question of syria and iraq prevented a pause in hostility the saudi military intervention in yemen since late march ha all but raised the stake to unprecedentedly dangerous level unlike in syria and in iraq the saudi military is now directly battling it out with iranianbacked rebel in yemen while riyadh no doubt exaggerates tehran role in the yemen crisis it fingerprint are nonetheless evident iran provides financial support weapon training and intelligence to houthis gerald feierstein a u state department official and former yemen ambassador told a congressional hearing last week we believe that iran see opportunity with the houthis to expand it influence in yemen and threaten saudi and gulf arab interest the iranian find the charge biased and point to the saudi airstrikes in yemen a a much bigger case of meddling in a neighbor affair in iran the cue came from the country top authority supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who ha been unusually blunt he tweeted despite dispute the saudi used to display composure with u but now inexperienced youngster have come to power replaced composure with barbarism three day after khameneis speech iran suspended religious pilgrimage to mecca this came a news broke about two iranian teenage boy who had reportedly been sexually assaulted by the police while visiting saudi arabia meanwhile antisaudi protest have been staged in a number of iranian city khameneis speech opened the floodgate of antisaudi statement the voice of hardline figure in tehran have been the most agitated general ahmad purdastan the commander of the iranian ground force taunted the saudi beware of the day when firecracker explode in riyadh purdastan said in a notsosubtle warning but it wa not only the hawk that came out swinging against the saudi ayatollah aliakbar hashemi rafsanjani a former president and arguably iran most vocal advocate of better iraniansaudi relation called riyadh military intervention a strategic mistake and urged for a political solution seeking a political solution is iran stated aim for the yemeni crisis but the prospect of such an effort succeeding are slim iranian foreign minister javad zarif ha provided a fourpoint plan to get a ceasefire to encourage the provision of humanitarian aid to promote political dialogue among warring yemeni party and to achieve the formation of an inclusive government but the iranian proposal also asks for an end to saudi airstrikes a zarif put it iran and saudi arabia need to talk but we can not talk to determine the future of yemen the saudi have thus far ignored the iranian proposal meanwhile the houthi leadership ha welcomed the plan a one of it leader said in iran plan unacceptable solution do not exist not only do the saudi not have any faith in any iraniandrafted political package that is welcomed by the houthis but riyadh belief that the international disposition favor it saudi arabia wa elated by the un security council vote on april that condemned the houthi movement only russia abstained but a solution to the yemeni crisis will not come from the un the un can provide a cover for riyadh military intervention but it can not secure it a military win this leaf riyadh with a fundamental question about how far it is willing to take it fight in yemen saudi airstrikes alone will not finish off the houthi movement and it ally in the yemeni armed force it requires ground troop on a huge scale riyadh ha tried hard to muster a military coalition that is willing to dispatch ground troop but it effort ha so far been nothing short of a fiasco the pakistani most famously turned down the saudi request and let it be known that yemen is a quagmire they can do without instead islamabad ha asked iran to push the houthis for a political compromise that riyadh can live with the turk were enthusiastic at first about stopping the houthis but in his visit to tehran last week turkish president recep tayyip erdogan made it clear that he ha prioritized iranianturkish trade relation over rivalry in yemen and emphasized a political solution for the yemeni conflict the egyptian and the jordanian are still supportive of saudi effort and claim publicly to be open to the idea of deploying military force to assist riyadh in yemen but whether they will go through with it is another matter egypt ha a long list of problem of it own including a bloody counterterrorism campaign in sinai that it can not afford to lose but also an eastern border with lawless libya that is increasingly a new front in cairo fight against jihadist it is hard to see how egyptian general abdel fattah elsisi can commit troop to a yemeni campaign that is not a direct threat to egypt security the same kind of domestic reality including the threat from isi will also prevent jordan from any significant contribution to saudi military effort in yemen these hard reality leave riyadh with two option it can look for or even mediate a political solution that will invariably include the same houthis that riyadh is attacking today alternatively given the absence of willing state to contribute ground troop riyadh will have to contemplate a fullscale invasion of yemen that is scenario that is very hard to contemplate the iranian too are faced with stark choice it is beyond tehran ability to tame the yemeni crisis a tempting a it might be for tehran to see the saudi bleed in yemen the danger of this conflict further fuelling sectarian tension in the middle east will undermine broader regional iranian interest a political compromise that both riyadh and tehran and their respective yemeni ally can live with seems to be the only option that is not cataclysmic\n",

thursday andreas hemmes a spokesman for the police of west hesse told cnn that the house and car of two individual in oberursel in the forested hill west of frankfurt had been searched a a result of what had been found police had expanded their search along the l road on the bike race route hemmes said we suspect that there wa a salafist background said peter beuth the interior minister for hesse referring to ultrafundamentalist interpretation of islam police investigation at this stage indicate that we have thwarted an islamist attack flade a journalist at die welt and terrorism researcher who first broke the story of the police raid told cnn that a german couple of turkish descent halil and senay d were under arrest he said the couple had tie to radical islamist circle in the frankfurt area neither is suspected of having direct link to the leadership of a terrorist group last week german police observed halil d moving in and out of a small forest near where he wa living they suspect he wa looking for a good place to hide a bomb along the bike race route according to flade flade said that according to german police document german police first became aware of the couple at the end of march when they went to a garden center near frankfurt to purchase hydrogen peroxide he said the store employee contacted police after becoming suspicious for several reason the first wa that the woman wa covered in a full veil the second wa that the couple claimed they wanted to buy hydrogen peroxide to clean their fish pond in their garden but the amount they were ordering would have been enough to clean dozen of such pond furthermore after police thwarted a bomb plot by german extremist trained in the tribal area of pakistan to kill american serviceman in germany in september with hydrogen peroxidebased bomb the socalled sauerland plot german law had required such store to report to police significant purchase of hydrogen peroxide according to flade after the tipoff german investigator began trying to figure out who the couple were all they had to go on wa the surveillance footage the woman wa fully veiled and her male companion wa blurry in the tape so they did not immediately know who they were but in early to midapril they were able to identify them and start surveillance to investigate the couple radical tie according to flade german police established that the couple had recently traveled to spain where they met with member of shariaspain a radical projihadist group linked to al muhajiroun in the united kingdom spanish police had monitored the meeting in spain they also established that the couple had link to radical who had gone to fight with aqim al qaeda north african affiliate and they found the couple were in contact with a young radical islamist from frankfurt who had gone to fight in syria at the end of last year and wa recently killed the pipe bomb that wa recovered by police appears to have similarity to device built by boston marathon bomber tamerlan and dzhokhar tsarnaev flade said the device recovered near frankfurt included nail a shrapnel the boston bomber downloaded instruction from a recipe in inspire magazine an

and security committee that inspire ha been read by those involved in at least seven out of the attack planned within the uk since it first issue in we judge that it significantly enhanced the capability of individual in four of these attack plot like other european country germany is grappling with an unprecedented terrorist threat because of the high number of it citizen who have traveled to syria and iraq in recent year there ha been growing concern over radicalization in germany large turkish diaspora community travel to syria is particularly easy for individual of turkish descent because turkey is the entry point for most foreign fighter traveling to syria according to flade almost german are believed to have traveled to syria and iraq with up to joining isi onethird of these

            "cnnthe death of freddie gray which wa the flashpoint for the protest and now the riot in baltimore ha raised again the question surrounding police use of force especially after the nowfamiliar video of officer arresting mr gray and loading him into a police van gray wa arrested by police on april the yearold wa carried in the van for minute and he wa not properly buckled in according to authority gray family said his voice box had been crushed and his neck snapped and after a week of hospitalization he died police commissioner anthony batts ha said we know our police employee failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple time the police and the u justice department are investigating the case raise at least three legal issue believe it or not the charging document in this case give u more information than the nowviral video of the arrestin that narrative police state defendant fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence according to the officer word thats the sole reason a stop wa initiated there is no other description of either criminal activity or safety concern the next sentence is important too the defendant wa apprehended in a specific location after a brief foot chase the police are locked in it appears that by their own narrative that the unprovoked flight wa the only reason for the stop because the very next thing that happensis the stop can the police stop you if all you do is run from them when you see them for the most part yes but having ground to stop is not the same a having probable cause to make an arrest in this case mr gray took off running the united state supreme court and maryland court have made clear that unprovoked flight running away from the police for no reason is enough to support reasonable suspicion that a crime ha been committed when you add to the suspect flight the supreme court recognition that the character of the neighborhood is also a factor in assessing reasonable suspicion it appears that the police in this case had at least enough to justify the stop constitutionally much to the chagrin of public defender and defense attorney a long a an officer testifies minimally to an individual running away in a high crime area the stop will usually be good but police are supposed to articulate the additional safety concern to get to the frisk police must also have reasonable suspicion that the suspect may be armed and presently dangerous to additionally conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing for the sole purpose of discovering weapon the charging document doesnt really identify a safety concern or doe it after the chase and before an arrest this officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pant pocket shouldnt that really say i saw a clip but whatever it wa clipped to wa inside a pocket where i couldnt see it thats a close call police were lawfully at the stop stage but the knife even though it wa inside his pant pocket wa visible from the outside because of an identifying knife clip see how artfully that wa done observation of a knife is definitely a safety concern observation of a clip i suppose that will get the officer to the frisk of the pocket assuming he is a connoisseur of knife clip and can differentiate them from hair clip chip clip etc according to william murphy an attorney for gray family he wa carrying a pocket knife of legal size and the lawyer contended that police didnt see the knife before the altercation the legality of the knife will be an issue but police have essentially conceded that the knife wa not seen until the stop the important thing here is that a stop and frisk is not the same a an arrest in theory if a stop give rise to no suspicion and a frisk yield nothing more than a comb and some pocket lint the citizen should be free to leave an arrest requires much more probable cause to believe a crime ha been committed and nothing le that knife wa the only crime he wa charged with so again police are locked into a narrative by their own report if it ultimately turn out to be a legal knife there will be a lot of scrutiny on the decision to arrest for example if the knife wa one of those pointy file attached to a inch nail clipper that doe not sound like good faith probable cause for an arrest remember also that based on the police narrative in the report they did not see the knife until after they seized mr gray so the question arises what would they have done with gray if he had no knife or other contraband on him they could but most likely not unless there wa some intentional act that resulted in gray death a weve seen charging officer with crime especially murder is rare and difficult if youre procop you could say thats because they are welltrained and rarely abuse their force if you have a more jaded view of law enforcement you would say it because they are welltrained and consequently very skilled at testifying or explaining their use of force baltimore police are suggesting mr gray injury occurred after his arrest while he wa being transported back for processing and that he may not have received proper medical attention thats not a surprise in fact from a liability perspective this is a good strategic move for the police it will be harder to hold them liable if gray injury happened after not before his arrest prearrest gray seizure would be judged by a reasonableness standard under the fourth amendment however court have limited these seizure to the initial act of seizing the person any excessive force claim after the arrest are not covered by the fourth amendment the claim of an arrestee are instead governed by a different constitutional provision the due process clause of the th amendment so what whats the difference between the fourth and th amendment anyway when it come to potential civil liability of the officer it make a huge difference the applicable burden of proof and chance of winning a lawsuit depend largely on which constitutional standard governs under the fourth amendment the test is whether the force wa objectively unreasonable based on the totality of the circumstance under the th amendment standard the officer will only be liable if the force wa applied maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering thats a much tougher burden for a plaintiff to meet fortunately court have held that pretrial detainee like freddie gray are entitled to at least the same protection under the th amendment a are convicted prisoner under the eighth amendment and it prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment in this case the deliberate indifference to medical need of prisoner confused youre not alone even a supreme court justice ha taken issue with this view of the constitution other jurisdiction have actually opted to extend the protection of the fourth amendment after arrest so not only could reasonable mind differ reasonable court judge and state differ too it just that maryland is not within one of those jurisdiction but it true it a kind of unintentional gap in constitutional coverage one the court have struggled to deal with based on the law it seems that if an arrestee is hurt during a rough ride police might avoid liability in maryland if they contend the injury wa not caused wantonly or sadistically thats a higher standard for liability than if freddie gray wa hurt prearrest so if it the truth it just happens to also be a constitutionally convenient one\n",

            "almost two week on from liverpool wretched afternoon against manchester united at anfield it would appear that lesson have already been learned asked about a setback that may yet cost brendan rodgers and his player a place in next season champion league the club midfielder joe allen wa rueful they were ready to go and maybe we werent allen told a young supporter at melwood this week yeah maybe the rivalry can sometimes get in the way joe allen battle it out with ander herrera during liverpool premier league defeat to man united at anfield liverpool midfielder allen spoke to sportsmails ian ladyman at liverpool melwood training ground midfielder allen belief liverpool have performed well against the big team during the last two season for allen and indeed for liverpool one suspect that their defeat by their greatest rival of all is already being viewed a merely another kink in the road certainly there is nobody at anfield who will accept the opinion offered by sky sport gary neville the former united defender that liverpool froze no i dont think thats the problem said allen i think over the last two season we have performed against the big team game can just be like that sometimes it doesnt happen very often next time that game come around we will get it right over the past few month at liverpool there ha certainly been more right than wrong going into saturday game at arsenal they are five point off fourth place in the barclays premier league but that still represents progress from the dark day of autumn and early winter allen one sens ha been integral to recent improvement with captain steven gerrard no longer an automatic starter and the brazilian lucas leiva recently injured the yearold midfielder ha been given an extended opportunity to prove his worth allen ha been given an opportunity with captain steven gerrard no longer an automatic choice for liverpool while gerrard is no longer the first name on the teamsheet lucas leiva left ha also been sidelined having arrived with rodgers from swansea in allen could not always be relied on he admitted this week that at time the challenge seemed a little too big for him but he hope that recent performance in big victory against manchester city southampton and swansea will one day be seen a evidence of a genuine breakthrough i think so i hope so allen told sportsmail personally i have always been confident that i just needed game i will be open and honest though in my first season there were moment when i look back and am disappointed about how i did cope with that mental aspect of thing maybe i underestimated it a little bit before i came i tried to anticipate it but you cant do it until you get here now i have come through that and the only issue this season ha been injury hopefully i can stay fit now and show people the best of me allen increased standing at liverpool saw him selected for a meet and greet with supporter this week guest of honour wa sean melia a volunteer at the anfield sport community centre who wa present at melwood a a barclays spirit of the game hero during a minute qa with a group of supporter allen talked openly about the sad feeling at the club when gerrard announced that he would not be staying and the devastation of last season title failure we understand that we gave it to manchester city he said allen admits at time the challenge of playing for liverpool felt a little too big but ha impressed recently gerrard console luis suarez a liverpool title hope were dented against crystal palace last season allen also spoke of the feeling at the club after captain gerrard announced he would be leaving the red later on however his conversation with sportsmail wa more personal and touched on his relationship with his older brother harry a talented footballer who play for the wale deaf side after losing his hearing to meningitis a a toddler when we were younger he wa a striker and he wa a better player than me revealed allen at primary school i played with him and his mate and that gave me a little bit of a head start a they were two year older he is profoundly deaf but he speaks so well i used to sign a little bit but he communicates so well now that i dont need to sibling rivalry is the perfect description of what we had though we loved playing against each other but there wa a competitive edge to it it a while back but i guess that is where the path all started for me it hard to say whether he would have made it it is something that i do wonder about but going out on to the pitch profoundly deaf is a huge disadvantage so i dont know it one of those that we will never know the answer to home these day for allen is the house he share in chester with his wife lacey and son alfie inherently private he wa a little embarrassed when lacey posted a photograph on twitter of last year birthday present then again a photograph of a top footballer holding a live chicken is rather unusual allen pose with a rooster bought for him by his wife for the liverpool midfielders th birthday allen wife laceyjo shared the snap of allen and his birthday present on twitter last year allen pose with sean melia a volunteer at the anfield sport community centre who wa present at melwood a a barclays spirit of the game hero it wa just a what do you get the guy who ha everything kind of present laughed allen fidgeting rather uncomfortably in his chair my wife is a big animal lover and it wa yeah my surprise present it ha got a name but im not telling you we already had a couple of chicken and this is a cockerel that wa the point of it really in the dressing room it a bit of a random one i keep my private life private and i guess that wa a rare insight we didnt realise what impact it would have but it wa harmless enough allen wa rather more comfortable when the conversation returned to football and in particular wales weekend win in israel that left chris colemans team at the top of their qualifying group for euro allen wa in cardiff millennium stadium in when mark hughes team lost a playoff to russia now he want to make some history with his country and finish off the work started by one of his early national coach the late gary speed allen is keen to make history with wale and finish the work started by former manager the late gary speed his presence is still there for everyone allen said poignantly he began this journey for u and his big dream wa for u to qualify in lot of way we want to make sure we can do this for someone like gary he wa a real people person for a young midfielder going into the squad he certainly had a huge impact on my career it wa a huge win for u in israel and we have a great chance now for me it wa the perfect thing to happen after the man united result thats the beauty of football there is always the next game to put thing right allen played in the win over israel which took wale to their top of their euro qualifying group domestically liverpool opportunity to make amends begin at the emirate tomorrow and continues in lancashire next wednesday with an fa cup quarterfinal replay at blackburn there is still much to aim for at anfield this season and with gerrard suspended for three game opportunity continues to knock for one of the next generation whatever happened in one game ha gone said allen we can start another run and do it again that ha to be our belief and confidence now last season we had a similar run we have to use that to inspire u if the team above u do slip up then we will be waiting joe allen wa speaking at a barclays event to inspire the next generation of fan to fall in love with the game to win barclays premier league ticket and other football experience search barclays spirit of the game\n",

trade union firebrand manner wa a warm a the weather didnt you once call me a slabfaced marxist the famously militant leader of unite asked me with a grin that wa more genial than menacing i had to confess i had but that did not stop red len mccluskey giving me the time of day on a street in neath a he conducted a twoday tour of the principality to drum up support for labour cause watching him in action it wa clear that he is highly popular with activist his gospel of traditional hardleft socialism go down well with the converted a doe his hackneyed anticonservative bile we look to wale a a beacon of hope to show what a labour government can do the tory might have the money but weve got the working people on our side he said to cheer and applause yet all the smile can not hide the reality that mccluskey and his union are a potent sinister force in british politics seeking to use their financial and organisational muscle within the labour movement to drag britain back to the dark day of the s a the mail reveals today the sheer scale of the influence unite hold on score of labour candidate is chilling given the socialist revolution the union would seek to impose indeed mccluskey a former liverpool dock worker who keep a drawing of lenin in his office and once boasted of presiding over more strike than any other union bos is quite open about his yearning for that period when the union held the government to ransom we are supposed to believe that the seventy wa a horrible time it wasnt it wa a time of great advance for working people he ha said labour umbilical link to mccluskeys union ha received much le attention in recent day than a potential deal with the leftwing antiausterity snp yet it is just a potentially disastrous for the governance of this country not only is unite which ha a claimed membership of million intertwined with the labour party structure mp and finance but it also remains addicted to the failed socialist policy of the past including a major expansion in the public sector le flexibility in the workplace higher taxation and ever more state spending just like nicola sturgeon mccluskey want to make labour bolder more radical courageous and brave only last month he appeared to threaten illegal action if a tory government pushed through further restriction on strike in the public sector when the law is misguided when it oppresses people and remove their freedom can we respect it i am not really posing the question im giving the answer it aint going to happen he declared despite all his talk about the oppression of working people however he ha not done badly for himself last year it wa revealed he received a rise taking his pay and pension package to mccluskey ha denied that he ha too much influence over ed miliband adding that unite is supporting the party per cent mccluskeys determination to influence labour wa all too evident in wale with an air of quasiregal grandeur he visited several factory gave talk to labour activist and held a number of photo opportunity including one in cardiff at the statute of that old champagne socialist nye bevan when i spoke to mccluskey he downplayed his hardline socialism instead talking about the need for investment in industry and the economy and he denied that he had too much influence over ed milibands party if only that were true he said while proclaiming his loyalty to the cause unite is supporting labour per cent he said adding that is now campaigning all over the country yet there wa something synthetic about mccluskeys protestation of support for labour a i watched him at close quarter it became more apparent that he wa going through the motion when asked in an interview with bbc radio wale about milibands leadership mccluskey could say only he doing ok beneath the surface i have no doubt he longs to hear ed offering more nakedly socialist policy rather than trying to appeal to middle england moreover if labour and unite really think that mccluskey is an asset in the election they are doing their best to keep quiet about it when i tried to find out mccluskeys schedule for his welsh visit from any number of unite and labour source including mccluskeys own press officer i wa greeted with either hostility or silence no one would give me any information it wa only through persistence and good luck that i managed to track him down to the outrage of his press officer who asked me paranoiacally how did you find u did you fit a tracking device to lens car that kind of anxiety and suspicion show more than just a lack of confidence it reveals a fear that just a with sturgeon spendthrift radicalism the hardleft dogma of unite is likely to alienate floating middleoftheroad voter such fear are of course only too justified for this is no smalltown demagogue on the contrary mccluskey is pivotal to labour future because of the stranglehold his union ha over the party it wa unite and the other affiliated union that ensured ed miliband wa elected leader in against his more moderate brother david who enjoyed greater popularity among labour mp and the rank and file since unite is estimated to have donated at least million to labour coffer it wa unite and the other affiliated union that ensured ed miliband pictured left wa elected leader in against his more moderate brother david right the dominance of unite run right through labour organisation with huge implication for the makeup of a putative miliband government one recent analysis showed that labour mp from the last parliament receive sponsorship from unite or are member of the union including senior frontbencher such a harriet harman angela eagle hilary benn and sadiq khan in addition labour candidate at this election are reported to have link to unite a martin mayer chairman of unites political committee and a member of labour national executive recently admitted the union is involved in a serious attempt to win back the party tragically for britain there is now a real danger that an incoming labour government would be forced to lurch even further to the left not just by snp by also by unite with miliband too weak to stand up to those who are determined he will be their puppet in downing street\n",

false promise he will say we will deal with people concern because we have listened we have learned and we have changed but only hour before the key election speech wa due to be delivered his own shadow home secretary refused at least four time to say labour would put a target on net immigration under intense pressure during a home affair debate on the bbcs daily politics show yvette cooper would say only she wanted the number to be lower than the current presenter andrew neil had pointed out that in office labour had virtually opened the door to record migration during labour year in power the foreignborn population rocketed by million home secretary theresa may trading blow with m cooper in the debate said the choice is clear back to a labour home office which they admitted wa not fit for purpose or the conservative who have a plan to reform free movement cut immigration defeat extremism and keep cutting crime the tory are fighting the election on a commitment to reduce net migration to the ten of thousand speaking in the vale of glamorgan today mr miliband will claim that labour would implement a tenpoint plan for curbing immigration during it first day in office it includes recruiting an additional border staff banning recruitment agency from hiring only from overseas and making it illegal for employer to undercut wage by exploiting worker however the tory are likely to point out that a number of the proposal are already in the process of being implemented they include the introduction of full exit check to count people in and out of the country and stopping those who have committed serious crime coming to britain mr miliband is expected to say david cameron once promised to cut net immigration to ten of thousand and told u to kick him out of office if he didnt deliver but only hour before the key election speech wa due to be delivered his own shadow home secretary yvette cooper pictured refused at least four time to say labour would put a target on net immigration union bos len mccluskey last night hailed ed miliband a britain next prime minister and said the country stood on the brink of change the unite general secretary praised labour for a series of radical policy including the freeze on energy price the mansion tax and the p income tax rate and he praised mr miliband for planning to repeal some of the worst antiunion law with a commission headed by john monk the former tuc general secretary addressing a rally of trade unionist in london mr mccluskey whose union is labour biggest donor said our nation stand on the brink of change in ten day the people will cast their vote they will pas their judgment on the last five year of tory coalition on the labour party and on ed miliband a our leader and our next prime minister he said labour offered something different and told the audience is it radical enough you judge for yourself labour would end bogus selfemployment and put a stop to the zerohour contract that have become a stain on our nation mr mccluskey added on tax theyre going to tackle nondoms a p tax rate for those who can afford it a mansion tax and above all tackling tax avoidance he said david camerons pledge to finish the job of deficit reduction were perhaps the scariest word in the english language last week mr mccluskey wa caught boasting that trade union own the labour party and it policy in the unite magazine he wrote the labour party is our party we built it to serve u these are our policy they are now within our grasp but net migration rose to last year almost exactly three time higher than he promised nothing damage people faith in politics more than broken promise like that or those he is still making today i will only make promise i can keep i wont offer false target or seek to exploit concern with the politics of fear instead i am offering clear credible and concrete way of making a real difference he will add immigration is too important an issue for our country to be abandoned by the prime minister so it can be exploited by nigel farage last week david cameron made a passionate plea to ukip voter not to risk letting in a labour government that will allow a return to uncontrolled immigration writing exclusively for the daily mail he said he understood people fear and worry about immigration it followed a poll showing six in ten are unhappy with the government record mr cameron wrote do you honestly think ed miliband care about controlling immigration no he wa there the last time remember when net immigration increased fivefold mr miliband ha apologised for the calamitous underestimate of the number of eastern european who would arrive in britain when the eu border expanded eastward in but he refuse to accept that unprecedented level of noneu migration were a mistake one exlabour adviser notoriously said the party aim wa to rub the right nose in diversity ed miliband ha revealed that a labour government would legalise humanist

would look to give the controversial ceremony the same status a religious and civil union there wa widespread support for humanist marriage across parliament during the passage of the equal marriage

            "the first ever mixed race miss japan ha lifted the lid on some of the horrific racial abuse she ha faced on her way to the top ariana miyamoto say it wa often punishing growing up a the only black girl in her class in the port town of sasebo near nagasaki where the u ha a naval base and where her africanamerican father met her japanese mother the yearold wa born and raised in japan speaks fluent japanese and wa last month chosen to represent her country in the miss universe pageant scroll down for video ariana miyamoto wa crowned miss japan last month but ha faced horrific racial abuse growing up ariana with her father bryant stanfield and a step sibling left a a youngster right she grew up in japan some critic of ariana win have complained she is a mixed race hafu and not japanese enough but the beauty queen had to use her first television appearance after her selection to apologetically explain to reporter that while she doesnt look japanese on the outside on the inside there are many japanese thing about her many in the country have expressed hostility to ariana title win a they expected the award to go to a pure japanese woman and not a hafu meaning half japanese which ha echo of the discredited term halfcaste is it okay to choose a hafu to represent japan one commenter typically wrote online after ariana win speaking about her childhood in an interview with mailonline ariana who go by her mother maiden name said there wa pretty much a spasmodic vomit of racial abuse heaped upon me i wa called a nr by some of my peer some of them threw trash and even a blackboard duster at me im japanese through and through but in japan if you look foreign you are often not accepted a japanese but i am japanese percent skin colour bear no relationship to what a person is it just one of the difference like wearing blue clothes or wearing red clothes i have no objection against the word hafu and i accept myself a being hafu with so little multiculturalism in japan the term is somehow understandable although it ha made me wonder who i am at time ariana ha been inspired by american singer mariah careys struggle to get to the top a a mixed race artist exemplified in her film glitter in which she play a young singer battling discrimination to make it to the top ariana with her mother she say she is japanese through and through i am japanese percent ariana will represent japan at miss universe having fought her way to the top despite racial prejudice the beauty queen grew up in sasebo near nagasaki but spent two year with her dad in the u a a teenager from his home in jacksonville arkansas ariana father bryant stanfield said his face hurt from nonstop smiling since his daughter scooped the miss japan award from a line up of more typical looking japanese woman earlier this month but he admits he been dismayed by some of the racist comment her win ha generated in japan just get to know her just dont attack her she will represent japan very well he told mailonline shes told me all about the bullying and how kid used to treat her how they hated her wavy hair threw thing at her even threw trash at her all pretty despicable stuff but i always told her and her mom said too you got ta be tough divided from the asian and russian land mass by fierce current many japanese have long believed in a myth of racial purity although the island inhabitant are a result of a hodgepodge of different migration mainly from korea china and the south sea the only native japanese are the caucasianlooking ainu people pushed to nearextinction to japan northernmost reach today those perceived of belonging outside the mythical japanese race are regularly discriminated against leading to a type of apartheid particularly when it come to renting housing a recent ruling by japan ministry of justice in kyoto declared that a no foreigner allowed rule by landlord is not in fact discriminatory thus cementing some of the institutional and casual racism nonjapanese face in contemporary japan the japanese like to think of their society and culture is unique according to theodore bestor a professor of anthropology and japanese study at harvard university which in a study put korea and japan at the top of racially homogeneous country largely unwilling to accept an influx of foreigner miss japan ha said there wa pretty much a spasmodic vomit of racial abuse heaped upon me growing up ariana with her japanese mother and a male friend she claim she wa called a nr by her peer the miss universe hopeful with a step sibling her father say she is proud of both her heritage one of the way in which japanese think of their own society a unique is to emphasise the homogeneity of japanese society and indeed by lot of comparison japan is certainly a much more homogeneous society than say the united state bestor told columbia university asian topic and it often said by japanese that they are ethnically homogeneous that there are no real foreign population in japan the election of a mixed race japan is a first for one of the world most ethnically homogeneous state the election of a black miss japan might be a step away from that misconception and mr stanfield agrees that the choice of his daughter represents some kind of progression in japan conversely he feel his darkskinned daughter would fair better in today america despite some recent headline created by racial strife in ferguson it different in america her being what and who she is there is not a second thought he said in reaction to the racist carping on japan social network since her crowning he belief some of the received wisdom about japaneseness might be at fault some people for a lack of a better word some people are ignorant im not saying that the whole of japan is ignorant but there some people who just dont know he said adding that in his three year in japan he personally had never experienced any racism it wa an encouraging sign that the japanese judge picked a mixed race miss japan he agreed showing the progressive aspect of a country that still ha the death penalty and where one tourism minister described his own onerace countryman a not keen on immigration or foreigner in contrast mr stanfield said in term of race relation the u is a much more rosy place than it once wa thing are changing here he said and agreed that the spread of more liberal attitude towards gay marriage wa just one example of how american is more enlightened and changing for the better it not a rapid change but slowly but surely it coming around i have to say what my daughter went through in japan she would not have experienced in the u there are always some people here who dont like you because of the way you look or because you are different so im proud of her sticking it out in japan and doing what she did becoming miss japan a a young man miss japan father life read like that of the american lead in madame butterfly where a handsome naval officer fall in love with a japanese geisha before finally leaving japan and his japanese bride and their daughter behind he met ariana japanese mother while on duty in the u navy at nagasaki in the s we moved stateside for a little while but her mother actually wanted ariana to be born in japan he said ariana father bryant stanfield say people in japen will never be a proud of her a i am after that my duty meant i couldnt be in japan for any length of time and slowly her mother and i drifted apart there no bad history her mother and i just went our separate way not until ariana wa a teenager did she renew her bond with her father after mr stanfield remarried and had three more child they were joined by ariana more permanently three year ago when ariana stayed in arkansas for two year to learn english and attend u high school english is not widely spoken in japan despite herculean education effort to teach it after returning from the u ariana started a career in modelling in japan it is a pastime often considered too showbiz by a traditionallyminded country and one where beautiful halfjapanese hafu offspring dominate ariana father is in little doubt she is proud of both heritage shes fully aware of who she is and shes fully aware of where she come from shes aware of both side the black side and the japanese side he said she just want everyone to get along and accept one another for what they are not because of the colour of their skin but for who they are a a person please tell japan to just accept her and just be be proud of her though i know they will never be a proud of her a i am\n",

latest in a long line quillin who had been out for a year initially hit the scale at and despite a quick run and hope session on the treadmill saw him register it wa not enough naturally the irishman still want to impress especially with the event screened live on u tv to an expected audience of million yet when the bell go he know nothing can destroy his own title dream he came back onto the scale and in the end it wa just too much for him to lose said trainer adam booth you can lose three pound in a short space of time but it didnt happen andy still ha to go out and do a job i think he knew he wasnt going to make the weight but he still tried he lost of a pound knowing that he wasnt going to make it he tried his arse off he couldnt make it thats not our problem all andy can do is his job and his job is to make weight professionally to be fit strong and ready for everything that can happen in this fight and he is i am still happy that i can fight andy but it is disappointing added a dejected quillin who had not fought for a year after vacating his belt to tend to his dying uncle a factor which clearly worked against him when aiming to reach the desired fighting weight i didnt want to let down any of my fan or family who wanted me to get my title back this wont effect my confidence nothing will break me and i will always stay in the eye of the storm the irishman took his world title chance by beating korobov for the wbo middleweight title the yearold admits he may have retired from boxing had he not beaten john jackson in june last year lee celebrates his world title win in december providing lee come through unscathed london billy joe saunders is the mandatory challenger while a lucrative fight against puerto rico legend miguel cotto is also a potential option it wa two hour of unexpected drama but no matter it simply mean lee ha even longer to bask in the spotlight what a difference month make last summer yearold irishman wa struggling to get a shot at the big time the end of his career wa lurching into view trainer booth sat the man from limerick down and laid it on the line if john jackson wasnt beaten and beaten well it could have been time to call it a day not only wa jackson superbly put to the sword he then went on to scoop the big one a brilliant flurry of right hand in la vega before christmas sent the previously unbeaten matt korobov crashing and the new wbo middleweight champion of the world wa crowned it wa just dessert for an underrated fighter who chiseled his inner grit strength and dynamism on the mean street of detroit under the legendary guidance of emanuel steward in his famous kronk gym on saturday come the chance to take another huge bite out of the big apple and back up promoter lou di bellas claim that the irish warrior is a superstar in the making quillin who boast a record of with ko say his month out of competitive action have seen him adopt a new found freshness and desire which should ensure one hell of a tussle at what should be a rocking barclays center in brooklyn there is a permanent glint in his eye lee though is ready kid chocalate quillin left pictured with gabriel rosado ha not been beaten in professional fight lee next fight could be a lucrative contest against legendary puerto rican miguel cotto right i have lived and fought in the u for year so this hold absolutely no fear for me some fighter from the uk may look at coming to the state and be thinking what a big platform it is and that could weigh on their mind he said i dont have those problem detroit wa a tough school to learn my trade the gym wa a kill or be killed atmosphere there wa no regard for reputation and you had to prove yourself every day i have fought in tough gym before but this wa the toughest it not just about the technical aspect people there are trying to knock your head off i wa the king of the gym but it ha helped me become the fighter i am there would be young lad ready to have a go but i took it all competition like that breed success i am sure he ha trained well but activity is an important thing for a fighter and could be a factor i am not banking on him being rusty but when you are fighting and making weight regularly everything come more naturally being a active a i have been is an advantage for me if it hadnt gone to plan against jackson we would have had to make some tough decision boxing is a hard game and it tough way to make a living i am so proud to be an irishman from limerick defending my title in new york city it doesnt get much better than this trainer booth right ha been holed up with lee in monte carlo ahead of the big fight on saturday holing up with booth in monte carlo ha got lee in tune for the biggest night of his life looking back did i think it wa going to happen for him no admitted the man who helped david haye become world champion i knew he would be able to win a title but it whether or not that opportunity would have ever come up the pressure of him achieving something ha been lifted and he expressing himself like never before it a joy to watch\n",

            "tuesday night against italy could be the most important england game michael carrick ha ever played the difference between the first and the second half wa like night and day when carrick came on england started to play having played in his position and alongside him it ha been frustrating to see him unappreciated in this country we have always had a major problem keeping the ball but carrick keep the game simple thats exactly what we need roy hodgsons team against italy looked like he had one eye on the future but the only future england need to be focusing on is euro if that mean going with a yearold michael carrick in the heart of midfield so be it tuesday night friendly clash with italy could prove to be michael carricks most important england game england international carrick keep the game simple but ha been unappreciated in this country carrick congratulates andros townsend following the tottenham widemans equaliser against italy in turin wayne rooney the best player on the pitch by a mile wa michael carrick he came on and dictated the game for u paul scholes last week he is not a flash footballer he doesnt hit hollywood pass he doesnt score lot of goal but i loved playing alongside him sir alex ferguson in december i still think michael carrick is the best central midfield player in english football i really do i think he is the best english player in the game even though he now it still not too late to start building the midfield around him if i were england manager thats just what id do look at andrea pirlo he is next month and ha blossomed in his later year his passing tore england apart at the world cup and he is worshipped in italy why cant we love carrick in the same way the fact he ha been ignored by england for so long is a sad indictment of where we have been going wrong for so many year in this country we tend to focus a lot on what player cant do rather than what they can we love allaction player like steven gerrard and frank lampard but thats why men like carrick can be left frustrated it wa not long ago that defensive midfielders had to snap into every tackle at manchester united in particular carrick ha had to deal with keane syndrome because he not roy keane he not a mobile he doesnt grab game in the same way and he certainly doesnt tackle like keane but that is not his style keane wa an amazing player but there will never be another like him and the game ha evolved carrick and ryan mason left applaud the travelling england support following tuesday draw with italy fan love allaction player like former england midfield star frank lampard left and steven gerrard andrea pirlo who turn next month tore england apart with his passing at last summer world cup the best deeplying midfielders of recent year have been passer not pit bull pirlo xabi alonso xavi sergio busquets all of them are cultured player who look after the ball and dont be fooled by a powerhouse like nemanja matic he can pick out any kind of pas with that left foot these arent just defensive destroyer any more these are the men starting the attack they may not have the best stats for goal or assist but they are at the heart of it all it the same with andres iniesta and luka modric they keep thing ticking over a doe carrick he make the pass that lead to the key pas the midfield that started in turin wa powerful and athletic but sometimes you need a bit of guile in a way it wa a good job the first half wa so poor a it meant carrick could come on and really show what he can do friendly might be a good time to experiment but that first half in italy made for some uncomfortable viewing phil jones ha had a decent season at centre back but looked awkward in midfield and england passing wa too slow and square carrick changed that all of a sudden there wa a different tempo to the game england were fluid and found more room to move against a tough opponent when he get possession carrick quickly get the ball out of his foot and try to slide pass forward he not the toughest of tackler but he doesnt need to be he read the game brilliantly and intercept the ball so well that he doesnt need to go charging after people he ha fantastic vision which mean his teammate can get into dangerous position they know that if anyone can pick out a pas it carrick he is so comfortable on the ball and probably england most twofooted player since glenn hoddle he not in hoddles class but he is so well balanced with both foot carrick take on midfield rival roberto soriano during england draw with italy at the juventus stadium xavi and nemanja matic are two of the world best deeplying midfielders and both have an eye for a pas carricks introduction against italy changed the game the tempo and saw england become more fluid ive said it before but carrick ha a nasty habit of passing to his own player it might not look flash but he make the game look easy thats why so many of his teammate love playing alongside him he might be a quiet personality but you can see the effect he ha on those around him united have been far better with him than without him this season and daley blind who many thought would replace him ha been shunted out of position thats because carrick is a better player in that role it also important to have experience in that position ive never felt it one for a young player hodgson ha tried jack wilshere but carrick know the role at club level of course wilshere could play next to him but at present carrick is the best man for the job considering he won his first cap against mexico in it amazing he ha not featured more for england he ha not always taken his chance but now is a golden opportunity to build our midfield around him it still not too late to make sure england have a pas master in place for euro carrick who made his debut in right could become england thirdlongest serving player at the euro\n",

there wa no change in the cost of surf with essential oil washing powder when it dropped from kg to kg it seemingly part of a strategy across the retail industry that enables manufacturer to increase

shrunk from surf washing powder and cif spray to hovis best of both bread while the price remains the same shrinking product can be an underhand way of raising price because pack size shrink but the price dont consumer will feel angry that they are being shortchanged by some of their favourite brand say which executive director richard lloyd it time for action on dodgy pricing practice that stop people from comparing product to find the cheapest it fiendishly difficult to compare price properly nowadays because special offer mean they change frequently indeed very often a negative story about a product shrinking in the medium will lead to it price magically shrinking for example after being featured in which this month because it had dropped from ml to ml but stayed at the same price in asda the supermarket giant discounted cif actifizz lemon multi purpose spray to f ood industry commentator martin isark belief the shrinking ploy is becoming more widespread it now common practice among the big confectioner and their argument is that they reduce the size so they dont have to put the price up he say pingpong price going up and down almost daily confuse the shopper so the brand

of tescos tomato and mascarpone sauce is a minute quicker to cook a you get g le whoever heard of a pack of five egg it seems cadbury ha when it controversially took an egg out the box angus kennedy editor of trade magazine kennedy confection say one of the worst example of shrinkflation wa cadburys reducing the number of creme egg in a box from halfadozen to five in the runup to easter both size cost at iceland if these company said were sorry but we have no choice but to do this because cocoa is now in short supply then i think the british public would be much more understanding he say what we dont like is feeling duped when we realise what the company are up to especially when theyre still paying for a sharing bag of maltesers thats down from g to g in fact cadburys finger have gone up from to in sainsburys this year despite the shrinkage confectionery company have argued that a reduction in the size of their bar is not all about rising production cost but is also an attempt to support the government drive to help people lose weight in the face of an obesity epidemic mr kennedy dispute this saying that a the bar get smaller people are likely to just buy and eat more manufacturer often claim that when they reduce the size of a product they pas on saving to shop but can not guarantee that they will in turn bring down retail price firm that were approached by which were unwilling to go into specific saying the information wa confidential spreading it thinly philly is down per cent but at least it healthier with le fat and salt going down cadbury ha snatched two chocolate finger from it famous pack reducing the number to now gram cadbury chocolate finger have come down by g the equivalent of two chocolate finger vince bamford buying and supply editor of the grocer say shrinkflation ha taken off because supplier are under pressure to maintain profit margin to keep shareholder happy and believe consumer prefer smaller product to price increase when we were in recession supplier and retailer were very wary of raising price he say but i dont think it would do them any harm to be more honest with consumer to say were having to pay per cent more for our product and were having to pas some of that cost on to you instead customer are left feeling shortchanged food and drink pricing always reflects the economic climate of the day whether thats the impact of changing utility price or ingredient cost which can be volatile say a food and drink federation spokesperson business seek to offset these cost wherever possible through improvement in efficiency and productivity but these action can only go so far and in some case company will reduce the pack size rather than increasing the price for consumer however it the underhand way in which these product change appear to be introduced that leaf a bad taste in the mouth of so many\n",

looking to do the right thing he said the shooting are among a climbing number of violent death in milwaukee this year the city ha counted homicide victim so far this year compared with at the same point last year there just seems to be a sensibility among a segment of the community that committing act of violence in support of one reputation to get revenge for a perceived slight or for a perceived business dispute over illegal drug or to exact revenge is somehow approved said flynn and in that set of circumstance there going to be not only tragedy there going to be dreadful mistake

            "the largest single highdefinition map of mysterious dark matter ha been produced it is the first in a series of map of the cosmos that will eventually allow a d view of dark matter across one eighth of the night sky and the map should allow astronomer to study how galaxy formed in the universe university of manchester researcher have revealed an hd dark matter map shown it show clump of mystery particle across per cent of the sky the goal is to eventually map per cent over five year red here show more dark matter and blue show le the moon is shown top left for scale a team from the university of manchester led by dr sarah bridle ha spent the past two year measuring the shape of galaxy used to construct the map and the map wa released today at the april meeting of the american physical society in baltimore maryland it wa created using data captured by the dark energy camera a megapixel imaging device that is the primary instrument for the dark energy survey de led by fermilab in the u the survey us the ft four metre victor m blanco telescope located at the cerro tololo interamerican observatory ctio in chile when physicist study the dynamic of galaxy and the movement of star they are confronted with a mystery if they only take visible matter into account their equation simply dont add up the element that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of object and the existing gravitational force there is something missing from this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that doe not interact with light but doe a a whole interact by mean of the gravitational force called dark matter this substance appears to make up at least per cent of the matter in the known universe and the project is run overall a part of the fiveyear dark energy survey de and is the largest map of this detail of course we cant actually directly observe dark matter yet so the survey instead look for it noticeable effect on galaxy studying this enables the predicted amount of dark matter in a given area to be mapped based on it gravitational effect dark matter could equally be called transparent matter because we see thing behind it that get distorted by gravity dr bridle told mailonline in the map she explained were seeing about time the area of the full moon which is about per cent of the whole sky the goal of the de is to map per cent of the entire sky creating a d map of dark matter and dark energy it is amazing to see a map of the dark matter over such a large region of the sky and the full dark energy survey mass map will be more than time bigger still dr bridle said in a separate statement analysis of the clumpiness of the dark matter in the map will also allow u to probe the nature of the mysterious dark energy believed to be causing the expansion of the universe to speed up this mosaic image show the different telescope shot that were combined to make the dark matter map the survey ha just completed it second year a scientist expand their search theyll be able to better test current cosmological theory by comparing the amount of dark and visible matter the survey ha just completed it second year a scientist expand their search theyll be able to better test current cosmological theory by comparing the amount of dark and visible matter those theory suggest that since there is much more dark matter in the universe than visible matter galaxy will form where there are large concentration of dark matter and hence stronger gravity present so far the de analysis back this up the map show large filament of matter along which visible galaxy and galaxy cluster lie and cosmic void where very few galaxy reside followup study of some of the enormous filament and void and the enormous volume of data collected throughout the survey will reveal more about this interplay of mass and light these map show how the amount of dark matter corresponds to the formation rate of galaxy on the left galaxy can be seen near dark matter clump in red and further away from sparse region blue the image on the right show some of the region of sky that were studied the team at manchester analysed million separate telescope image of galaxy to make the map the process of measuring the galaxy is so complex and time consuming that some of the world largest supercomputer are needed to do it each time a new catalogue is made it take about a much computing power a running ordinary desktop computer for two week we have to measure the shape of each galaxy how distorted it is with extremely high precision about one part in said dr joe zuntz also of the university of manchester who ha been making the measurement the survey us the ft four metre victor m blanco telescope middle located at the cerro tololo interamerican observatory ctio in chile outfitted with a newly designed stateoftheart dark energy camera decam it will be completed by mapping dark matter of an eighth of the sky in the process dark matter the mysterious substance that make up per cent of all matter in the universe is invisible to even the most sensitive astronomical instrument because it doe not emit or block light but it effect can be seen using a technique called gravitational lensing studying the distortion that occurs when the gravitational pull of dark matter bend light around distant galaxy understanding how the clumpiness of dark matter change with time will reveal the nature of the enigmatic dark energy which is the ultimate goal of the survey the dark matter map released make use of early de observation and cover only about three percent of the area of sky de will document over it fiveyear mission\n",

month later he want to make sure the devastating pain he feel never happens to other family it wa also revealed by stuart friend and former sailor matt henry who had also attempted to take his own life on several occasion that ice use and drinking wa rife within the rank of hmas sterling mr henry said ice wa the drug of choice in western australia because it wa so readily available through their sailor friend he said he believed his friend use of the drug ruined their life another sailor brett dwyer who served alongside stuart took his own life just three month after his best friend bretts doctor advised the navy he should not have been sent to sea due to chemical burn on his hand but he wa sent to hmas stirling where he wa bullied by navy personnel his rsl counsellor brian oneill said one disgusting incident involved brett being dangled overboard by his leg by shipmate in late brett wa discharged after saying he had used drug including ice mr oneill said the young sailor wa not taking the illicit substance and just said he did to break free of the navy we woke up in the morning and he wa hanging on our balustrade which is in the middle of the house his mother and i had to cut him down bretts father mark dwyer told the national broadcaster like the addisons bretts family did not find out about his medical history until after his death brett wa on psychiatric medication to treat his depression stuart family did not know he wa on psychiatric medication and sister jessica ames said they were kept in the dark by the navy rsl counsellor brian oneill said mr dwyer told the navy he wa taking ice to get out of the service i wouldnt wish that on any family what they did wa wrong mark said they think of him a a number he wasnt a number he wa our son three more similar case of men who took their own life were revealed in the report their mental health issue and suicide attempt were kept inside the navy and their family only became aware

to sweep this issue under the carpet ewens sister kenna crichton said he tried to take his own three time before he shot himself in october following the death of best friend stephen who committed suicide six month earlier while jake casey who wa pallbearer for brett dwyer developed an ice habit and hanged himself three day before the first anniversary of his friend death he had ice in system when he wa found but one navy wife tried to warn the service about the problem when she found out her husband had a drug habit the wife of bradley livingston said he had a drug problem and took ice which she tried to warn his commanding officer about karley livingston said her claim were ignored and she wa treated by the officer a a stupid navy wife mr livingston died of a suspected drug overdose but it is not clear if he wanted to take his own life karley livingston husband bradley livingston died of a suspected drug overdose and had tried to prevent this from happening by going to his commanding officer she wa told by the officer to go to the chaplain and wa treated like a stupid navy wife the navy said it wa now investigating m livingston claim the service ha reviewed it privacy policy about suicide attempt and will not be making change reported defence conducted a review of health information practice in late the navy said in a statement the review reaffirmed that it is the member who determines who ha access to their personal health information and recommended that there be no change to defence policy or practice in third party disclosure\n",

andreas rasmussen christian boyum johansen and johan berg are filmed by emil fogh standing just centimetre away from the shark theyve captured in an activity that is terrifying but completely legal in new zealand to the point it ha become a competitive sport one of the man stand at the water edge with a fishing line in his hand and the wave lapping at his foot when suddenly he launch forward dragged by the great weight of the creature who ha attached itself to his fishing line the first fisherman is dragged deep into the water from the water edge within second when the mighty shark take hold of the end of his line once captured one person brazenly open the shark mouth whilst the other remove the hook the fisherman and his friend whoop with excitement certain they have achieved their goal to catch a shark the line spin rapidly a their catch continues to swim around and the fisherman is pulled deeper and deeper into the water at an alarming rate the fisherman friend grab hold of his shoulder and together they pull against the shark on the end of the line determined to bring it into shore a one person hold onto the line a massive shark leap out of the water le than two metre away thrashing violently to try release itself from the hook the three men in the video cheer excitedly without a hint of apprehension the shark is then pulled into shore it huge teeth le than a metre away from the foot of the man who brazenly jerk it in to land a the fisherman is dragged after the shark his friend grab hold of his shoulder and they forcefully pull the shark closer in to shore the video then cut to a few moment later a the shark now inexplicably still and unresponsive is pulled in to the sand by it tail the three men oncamera comfortably stand next to the shark centimetre away from it face and grab it by the head to release the hook a man in short kneel next to the two metre shark in the water holding it up by it fin and tail the shark is then pushed back into water by it tail for a moment the bronzer shark snap it head around a if to attack but it proceeds to swim back into deep water a it is legal to fish for shark in new zealand it ha become a sport known a big game fishing in which shark angler catch and release the creature one of the men stand just a metre away from the thrashing shark to pull it onto the sand however it crucial that the sport is only attempted by those that know the technique which are safe for both the participant and the shark to ensure everyone involved remains alive for many new zealander it ha become a business to allow people particularly tourist to take part in the landbased shark fishing catch and release experience company promise that participant can expect to catch fish such a large tiger shark and hammerhead in place such a new zealand tauranaga harbour shark fisherman focus on using peep release technique to send shark happily on their way after gaining biggestcatch bragging right the catch and release philosophy is in keeping with new zealand dedication to conservation and sustainable fishing according to the new zealand tourism guide website even in nonrelease area many angler adopt the catch and release principle or simply bag only their last catch of the day to take home for eating for the sea creature to survive it is crucial that people engaging in biggame fishing handle their catch minimally the fisherman whoop and cheer with delight a the bronzer shark desperately try to escape when using the catch and release method angler should realise that prolonged handling decrease the fish chance of survival the website say new zealander even compete in big game finishing tournament including the ssi sharkin catch and release tournament which will be held from may and offer prize money for the biggest catch there are about specie of shark in new zealand water and of these more than specie are caught by fisher in october new zealand finally banned the practice of shark finning a move that wa seen a finally diminishing a primitive practice and bringing the country in line with other developed nation new zealand conservation minister nick smith said the move reinforced the country reputation for sustainability and environmental protection a man grin widely a he hold the shark near the water edge with a hand on it tail and another on it fin but the shark doe not turn around to snap at it captor the new rule made it illegal to remove fin from dead shark and dump the carcass at sea it wa already illegal in new zealand to remove fin from live shark shark fin soup is considered a delicacy by some in china but the practice of shark finning ha been condemned by many environmentalist a inhumane and wasteful pew charitable trust estimate at least million shark are caught commercially each year threatening the survival of some specie new zealand official estimate that commercial fisher catch about ton of shark annually and export about ton of shark fin imogen zethoven director of pew global shark conservation campaign said in an email the ban wa an important first step although wa unlikely to reduce the number of shark caught in new zealand she said pew would like to see nation impose complete ban on catching shark specie threatened with extinction and sustainable catch limit placed on other specie the shark is then released back into the ocean and

only one i spent my time there scouring the face of the woman and men that i met trying to spot a wobby chin or weak lower cheek a a matter of fact i couldnt find a single jowl on anyone these woman had expression line wrinkle around their eye and on their forehead when speaking but chin and jaw line that were a tight a a girl just sitting her gcse scroll down for video forget botox or chemical peel the latest celebrity beauty craze is having a tight jawline like emma stone and im not just talking about somethings like emma stone or margot robie but even amongst the over s and the somethings there wasnt a slackened jowl in sight it not just about being thin there tightness that on planet earth a far a i can tell just shouldnt naturally be there so just how do they do it a a something woman who is sadly observing a jaw line that appears to be more and more desperate to rendezvous with my neck each and every day it ha become my latest obsession after some call to my best insider alist doc it seems the new trend in celebrityville these day is not about hiding your wrinkle instead it the nefertiti lift aptly named after the egyptian queen famous for amongst other thing her very defined jaw line dr barbara kubicka say she ha client coming in each and every day asking for botox not on their forehead but designed to firm their jaw line dr barbara kubicka see a host of celebrity at her knightsbridge clinic and say that while the whole world expects it wrinkle that age you it actually your face shape thats making you look older she ha client coming in each and every day asking for botox not on their forehead but designed to firm their jaw line here why the first thing that our mind ass when it come to judging the age of the person is shape of their face dr kubicka say our face change with time from a triangle high cheek bone and defined jaw line to a square with a heavy jaw line and double chin the shape of the face is much more important than the line and fold in fact according to recent research we universally recognise a younger a person who is wrinkly but ha a youthful face shape thus traditional botox on the forehead alone doesnt improve appearance but changing the shape of your face and tightening your jaw line doe getting a nefertiti lift or lower face rejuvenation ha become a must have in hollywood right now and you can understand why ashley say the latest anti aging treatment is the nefertiti lift for jowl think about the love scene how many of u can say with confidence we dont have double chin when lying down i dread to think what mine look like and these actress are filmed that way and just a badly from the side whist talking how i dread those photo showing up on facebook indeed for those of u who live our life off camera or shall we say with le pressing incentive than our celebrity friend have there still a feeling of wanting to look the way we used to the good news is though that apart from a lower face lift which let be honest plenty of actress have for those of u who want to avoid going under the knife there is a lot of other stuff out there we can do indeed dr kubicka of clinicbe confirms that there a lot that can be done without surgery you can jab it access to soft and fat tissue around the jaw line and under the chin can be corrected with up to session of aqualyx which is a new and improved version of flab jab it work to dissolve fat cell and allows u to pas them out of our body when we urinate pound per treatment you can tighten it loss of skin laxity can be rectified with different skin treatment like dermaroller radio frequency or laser and loss of volume on the upper face resulting in a lower face drop can be improved with dermal filler or sculptra you can lift it over active platysma muscle on the neck that pull the corner of the jawline down with every contraction can be relaxed with muscle relaxant injection such a botox which give an effective lift botox muscle relaxing injection nefertiti lift treatment last month and finally dr kubicka say that the best innovation over the last couple of year is thread these have been around for a while remember madonna wa snapped with that suspicious scarring that wa widely believed to be a thread lift brand new to the market are pdo thread a korean innovation that is suitable for both lifting and tightening it far le invasive than traditional thread there is no hook to hook them on and there are many size and length of thread available which allows treatment to every part of the face and even the body a much a they lift they result in an increase of collagen production and line improvement a a bonus pdo thread price on consultation treatment last up to month and with all of these treatment subtlety is what youre aiming for say dr kubicka the greatest advantage is that we can improve the lower face lift it and tighten without adding extra volume a seen before with the dreaded pillow face look which allows u to achieve not only a younger but a well more naturally beautiful facial appearance\n",

however is her penchant for beluga caviar no it not the extortionate price a if rather the fact it far too high in salt and fat besides a girl need to watch her weight and choupette like to stay at a

establishment coverups by deciding that labour peer lord janner should not be charged despite evidence of offence against nine victim dating back to the s birthday visit lord janner right with cake took michael jackson who wa repeatedly accused of child abuse but cleared in court on tour of parliament in together with their mutual friend of uri gellar and u magician david blaine centre left it wa the birthday of labour mp paul boateng alongside janner theresa may became the first cabinet minister to question the dpps judgment in ruling that the yearold should not be prosecuted on the ground that his dementia is now too advanced for him to have a fair trial the home secretary told the bbc i wa very concerned when i heard about this decision i have been very clear in everything i have said so far about the child sexual abuse issue i expect to see justice done former dpp lord macdonald of river glaven said it would have been better if lord janner had undergone a procedure whereby a jury can decide on the fact of a case without apportioning guilt and without a sentence being passed if a suspect is unfit to plead there have been a number of recent court case in which defendant with dementia have been jailed and lord janner himself ha previously called for nazi war criminal to be put on trial regardless of their age or frailty lord macdonald added it might have been wiser for the crown prosecution service to say were going to have this matter resolved in the full public glare of a courtroom rather than simply by the dpp adam simmonds police and crime commissioner for northamptonshire said the decision not to charge lord janner on thursday made it a dark day for our justice system he added a substantial number of victim of child abuse who have carried the weight of such heinous crime with them for the best part of two decade have been terribly let down in the worst possible way he said the dpps ruling went against her previously stated commitment to seek justice for victim no matter how old the allegation alison saunders right said her job a head of the crown prosecution service wa to make the correct legal decision in difficult case not the most popular one lord janner left leicestershire constabulary which ha investigated lord janner four time over the past year is considering an unprecedented legal challenge against the decision simon danczuk the labour mp who exposed the late cyril smith a a paedophile said that the weight of criticism against mr saunders meant something had clearly gone very badly wrong writing in today mail on sunday below he said mr saunders is now seen a a roadblock to justice and it hard to see how her position remains tenable mr saunders ha also come under fire over other highprofile case and ha been involved in a number of dispute over the competing right of suspect and alleged victim in sex assault case her decision in the lord janner case could be overturned if the complainant use the right to review scheme introduced two year ago a cps employee with no prior involvement in the case would consider if her decision wa the right one alleged victim of lord janner will eventually be able to share their experience with the longdelayed public inquiry into historic child abuse to be chaired by new zealand judge lowell goddard however that investigation face further setback a campaigner are seeking a judicial review of her decision to exclude child abuse survivor from the inquiry panel for being insufficiently objective the cps handling of previous investigation into lord janner is also being reviewed by retired high court judge sir richard henriques last night the cps said the dpp is there to make the right legal decision her role is to make these very difficult decision not to make popular decision roadblock to justice must be removed by simon danczuk mp who exposed the cyril smith scandal mp simon danczuk who exposed the cyril smith scandal a few week ago i met an experienced former metropolitan police officer to discus investigation into high profile child abuser active in the s were making progress but putting rolf harris and max clifford behind bar isnt going to trouble the establishment he remarked itll be time harder to prosecute a politician theyre able to call in a lot of favour a year earlier id met police officer from leicestershire to discus the case they were putting together against lord janner i could tell they were determined to get a prosecution but it wa the question they put to me next that disturbed me almost a much a the allegation do you think there will be any political interference the fact that dedicated frontline officer investigating heinous crime against vulnerable child should have to ask that in st century britain is a worrying sign but it one we should come to expect given the continual revelation about previous failure to prosecute highprofile figure for abusing child the decision by the director of public prosecution to use the public interest test to overrule the evidence when refusing to prosecute lord janner is a reminder that outdated attitude still prevail they throw our whole justice system into disrepute not just because the authority continue to turn a tin ear to those who have been violated disbelieved and treated a rubbish for decade and not just because in admitting previous failure to prosecute janner alison saunders failed to apologise on behalf of the cps it appalling because it the wrong decision and one she didnt have to make for the dpp to shut down any prospect of justice in such a case sends out the worst possible message at the worst possible time and her reputation is unravelling fast when the home secretary say shes very concerned the former dpp lord macdonald is critical and leicestershire police are talking about a legal challenge then something ha clearly gone very badly wrong so wrong that mr saunders is now seen a a roadblock to justice and it hard to see how her

            "cnnpresident abraham lincoln never lost his ardor for the united state to remain united during the civil war in his second inaugural address he attempted to salve the nation with an eloquent summation of his philosophy and plan for putting it into practice with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right a god give u to see the right he orated let u strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation wound to care for him who shall have borne the battle for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nation the spirit of lincoln second inaugural wa selfevident on april year ago when confederate gen robert e lee dramatically surrendered his approximately troop to union general ulysses s grant at appomattox courthouse mclean house in virginia over american northerner and southerner alike had perished in the bloody civil war but the carnage wa now about to end the historic meeting between grant and lee began with pleasantry about the weather and their mutual service in the mexican war the good fellowship wa palpable lee in fact had to abruptly remind the chatty grant about the diplomatic business at hand after all they were at appomattox courthouse to hash out term of surrender grant purposely ended up being generous to confederate soldier they would be paroled not condemned to prison camp rebel officer were even allowed to maintain their sidearms personal property of southerner would now be respected even ration were provided by grant for lee hungry soldier it wa palm sunday and in the spirit of christian reconciliation grant ordered that no celebration occur within union army rank the confederate were now our prisoner grant wrote and we did not want to exult over their downfall the mythmaking about appomattox started from the moment lee left the courthouse on his horse to travel to richmond surrendering hadnt been easy for lee sullen from defeat his own family property in arlington had been confiscated by union force converted into a union cemetery with line of white cross on the lawn all acre of his virginia land holding had been stripped from him by the u government with no real home lee rode to richmond depressed and destitute rendezvousing with his sick wife mary curtis lee at a spare apartment remarkably the stoic lee didnt express bitterness in public when news reached lee that lincoln had been murdered in fact he wa distraught calling it a crime that wa unexampled and deplorable although much remained unresolved between the victor and vanquished the little courthouse became a symbol of unity just like the star spangled banner from the war of one postappomattox story that ha long interested me wa that of littleberry walker after being present at lee dramatic surrender at appomattox walker a battlefatigued confederate laid down his rifle and journeyed back to redclay georgia traveling mainly on foot passing ragged cluster of rebel amputee many hobbling on bayonet crutch others with arm or head swathed in bandage and all heading in the same direction home upon arriving in atlanta a weary walker found the confederate railroadcity smoldered in ruin the handiwork of gen william t sherman scorched earth policy onehundredtwenty year later walker greatgrandson th president jimmy carter would construct his carter center an ngo dedicated to diplomatically resolving global conflict on the very hilltop overlooking atlanta on which gen sherman once stood upon leaving atlanta walker continued walking south anxious for his kinfolk unfortunately he returned to sumter county only to learn that his father had died and that the family farm wa teetering on the brink of bankruptcy one suspect inman the main character of novelist charles fraziers cold mountain spoke for the battlehardened civil war veteran like walker when he lamented that what you have lost will not be returned to you it will always be lost youre left with only your scar to mark the void all you can do is go on or not but if you go on it knowing you carry scar with you a we reflect on the sesquicentennial of lee surrender at that forlorn virginia courthouse today marvelously maintained by the national park service we recognize that the scar of the civil war are still with u the masondixon line divide still exists almost all the old confederate state are now considered red republican while the union state are blue democrat a residual variation of big federal government versus state right paradigm of the civil war era while the old spiritual slavery chain done broke at last wa sung by black in the hour following the appomattox surrender racism sadly continues to be a crippling national scourge while there no longer are beating in congress like in when preston brook of south carolina caned charles sumner of massachusetts on the congressional floor the gridlock on capital hill in the inability to get anything done is similarly coldcocking the spirit of our participatory democracy all american eye should be fixated on appomattox today the mclean house is our collective sanctuary of national healing a a public place the mclean parlor remains small but the legacy which grant and lee made at the truce table is timeless in world history for while the scar of the monstrous civil war still remain the wound have closed since in large part because of the civility of grant and lee with grace and dignity these brave west point general gave righteous credence to lincoln with malice toward none finery\n",

penis restricts his sex life he say it make him more creative in the bedroom he told vice after you reach a certain size you cant do certain thing any more at least not with everyone and not without some foreplay but there are other thing you can do with it you just have to free yourself from established role and idea about sex and be ready to play mr stunzs interest in penis modification year ago when he wa given a pump a a present i wa way too curious not to try it out first i tried it secretly for myself he said and i found that when i went out pumped up it wa a good feeling it felt great mr stunzs interest in penis modification were piqued when he wa given a penis pump at yearsold and found it felt great he moved on to saline injection before opting for the more permanent silicone one i had the feeling that i wasnt trapped in the body i wa born with but that i had the possibility to shape it myself to change it he then began enlarging himself with saline injection the feeling wa great he said but i didnt like getting the injection there always a risk of infection and also the people around me started to wonder why my groin area would change in size thats why i started looking for something more permanent it took him several year to find out about silicone injection which were only available in london when he first began researching them however rather than seeking professional medical help he met a medical student who agreed to perform the first injection to date mr stunz ha had four procedure which involved injecting silicone into his penis and scrotum however dr aref el seweife a urologist in berlin who carry out penis enlargement warns that an injecting silicon into the penis can lead to an infection that will leave it mutilated in worst case it can lead to an enlarged artery in the scrotum and the testicle die he told vice journalist urging people who opt for the procedure to have it done by a medical professional in fact a study in the

modesty and refrain from telling certain people such a his bos or his extended relation about his enlarged penis mr stunz accepts this advice and agrees that others thinking of having their penis enlarged with silicone should make sure they are fully informed while his situation might seem extreme he claim he lead a normal life he said i go to work buy grocery go to bar club and to the movie i

normally sized and normally functioning penis doctor say these patient interpret normal appearance a abnormal and a such are distressed and depressed source urology annals he also prefers to urinate sitting down in a cubicle a he attracts odd look when using urinal while sometimes he say he is pleased to get so much attention at other point he hide his modesty he us a satchel bag to hide his bulge and refrain from telling some people in his life about his physical appearance there are definitely situation when i say the other person doesnt need to know right now when it the bos or all the extended relation then ill tell a white lie im actually a pretty shy person he explains while leatherclad at a bondage festival indeed one of his favourite event of the year is the folsom europe festival a bondage fetish and latex affair in berlin when he attends the carnival he wear a speciallymade pair of latex pant to show off his huge penis speaking of why he love the event he said you can offer up who you are and show yourself the way you want without having to think about what other people will think of you he sometimes worry that potential partner are only interested in him for his manhood he said you get reduced to the bulge obviously there always that danger in the relationship but if you take the time to get to know the other person you find out whether he really love you or just a part of you ultimately mr stunz believed the interest in his penis modification belies deeprooted sexism if some woman get breast enlargement nobody say anything about it he said if a man doe something very similar to his body it worth making a documentary about it because it so extraordinary i hope that change soon because the difference really isnt that big mr stunz said the silicone

nature there wa no kicking water bottle but he wa visibly distraught despite the consolatory effort of michael essien behind him fast forward month and there wa an altogether different kind of substitution in the st minute of last sunday manchester derby after scoring and inspiring united to win he received a standing ovation and a pat on the back from ryan giggs manchester united midfielder juan mata turn away to celebrate after scoring against manchester city mata had scored uniteds third goal during the victory over their bitter rival at old trafford last week mata look dejected after being substituted by chelsea bos jose mourinho last year at stamford bridge although he had been a popular figure at chelsea mata could not convince mourinho to keep hold of him louis van gaal is finally getting the best out of juan mata in his last five game the spaniard ha performed better than he ever ha in the premier league mata is performing at the peak of his power he is not surprised by the turnaround in his own and the team fortune he began the season believing united could win the league this year with no european commitment he told sportsmail last may if we take liverpool a the example there you have a team who have fought all the way to the finish without the champion league he wa mocked for the optimism but if united beat chelsea at stamford bridge they will be only five point behind the leader when david moyes wa manager he and assistant phil neville had scouted europe for the matatype player they believed the team needed before it became clear united could get the real thing when louis van gaal arrived mata took one step forward and two back the early tinkering often meant he played in his favoured position behind the front two but the threeman defence experiment undermined everything else the team did and result were poor he ended up back where he had been at chelsea under mourinho on the bench mata missed the football he had played earlier in his career at valencia and under andre villasboas at chelsea the free spirit wa being shackled and the only consolation wa that others felt the same none more so than ander herrera the player he is closest to at the club the two had won an under european championship together with spain where they had enjoyed a freedom of expression now denied them herrera like mata wa out of the side mata also missed london when i interviewed him in before the champion league final he insisted on meeting in a king road cafe because it wa where he felt most at home now he wa in a mansion in alderley edge south manchester isolated and not playing a uniteds fortune changed on the pitch however so matas season ha been saved with michael carrick now planted in front of a back four the side ha the balance to allow it creative player to thrive mata is not in his favoured no position but he is also comfortable on the right i can come inside on my left foot and see the whole of the pitch in front of me he say mata enjoys a close friendship with fellow untied midfielder and spain international ander herrera right mata score the second of his two goal against liverpool at anfield this season a stunning overhead kick it is the same left foot giggs joked about with him when he joined saying he wa glad to see him arrive but unhappy that he no longer possessed the best left peg at old trafford the relationship with giggs is healthy a is the one struck up with wayne rooney both were player mata admired before moving to england a well a the bond with herrera he is close to david de gea all three of them live on the same street de gea is another with whom mata played in that under european championship success in denmark in having been part of the world cupwinning squad matas willingness to step back down to the under s say a lot about his character the open letter he wrote to chelsea fan when he left the club against advice that it wa not the best way to ingratiate himself with his new supporter also spoke volume a chelsea fan hold a sign to pay tribute to mata who earned himself a hero reputation in west london mata never wanted to leave london but now he love the countryside surrounding manchester it reminds him of his home in asturias and that more than make up for not being in the capital life there wa good under villasboas he trusted me to play and he want to play attractive fun and winning football he said revealing a fondness for someone whom mourinho held in far lower esteem mata never banged on the manager door when he fell out of favour at chelsea mourinho never struck him a a man whose mind could be changed he ha always preferred to do his talking on the pitch it ha not always been easy but he is back at chelsea on saturday and there ha never been a better time to make a lasting statement mata get ready to play a pas during a club training session at the aon training complex on friday\n",

urgent medical attention after her scalp became infected however tina who spent the day of her th birthday in bandage said the incident ha not deterred her from hair hair extension again scroll down for video tina campbell paid for hair extension and wa left with a hole in her head a close up of one of the boil which developed on her scalp miss campbell who work a a showbiz writer said everyone want luxurious lock like kim kardashian and cheryl fernandezversini but what if you could get them at a fraction of the cost said miss campbell that wa the proposition when i met up with a friend who suddenly had the most amazing long flowing blonde hair she told me it a weave and she got it done at an african hair shop i asked whether it wa just for afro hair but she said it wa fine adding that they would put my hair into cornrows and then sew the extension in tina campbell look glamorous with her new glossy hair extension a few week after having the weave she developed painful boil i couldnt believe it when she told me the cheap price it wa for a full head while some salon charge hundred or even thousand having struggled to grow my own hair and often experimenting with clipins i soon found myself getting it done too being able to go to bed with perfect hair and wake up with it wa a revelation people would always comment on how nice it looked and i wa hooked miss campbell said that after the extension had gone their course instead of going back to the same place that she had them done before she decided to save time and go somewhere closer to home tina spent her th birthday in bandage after her hair extension nightmare left and right the stylist at the salon in welling south east london did not fill me with confidence she said she wa vague when discussing the price and simply waved me to sit down so she could start there and then i could see the needle sitting on the side in blue antiseptic liquid i didnt have a great feeling about the place but i wanted them done for an event that night so i bit the bullet they ended up charging me way more than last time however miss campbell said that a few week after having them put in her scalp started to itch unbearably and she started to notice small lump forming concerned i took them out but the lump one on top of my head and a cluster lower down towards my neck seemed to grow and harden she said the doctor said they were boil which id never had before and said to bathe them instead of looking pretty on her th birthday tina spent the day in bandage after having the boil surgically removed miss campbell said that day later pu began oozing from the one on top of her head which although looked disgusting seemed to ease it not so for the others though she added they were fusing together and causing the area to swell the pain wa excruciating and id stay up with my head in my hand willing it to stop then the night before my birthday the lump burst and thick red lumpy liquid seeped out that burned a it touched the raw skin le than hour later i wa lying on a hospital bed having a section of my head shaved fully awake and shaking with fear i gritted my teeth a a doctor cut a hole into my skull to drain the infection despite having had nine needle injected into my head to try and numb the area i could still feel it and the sound of scalpel on bone wa like something from a horror movie i told the doctor to shave it all off but thankfully it didnt come to that i had to wear the bandage on my head for three week afterwards making outpatient visit to have the hole in my head filled with a special material and the dressing replaced looking good tina pictured on the red carpet while covering the oscar say despite her experience she ha not been put off having hair extension the medical opinion wa that the cause had been a dirty needle used to sew the extension in my doctor said that it could have nicked my scalp a the hair wa attached to the cornrows miss campbell said that when confronted the salon owner wa adamant it wa the hair itself that wa the cause and a the customer had provided it wa not down to her shortly afterwards the salon changed it name and ha since closed down added miss campbell since then ive sporadically had similar abscess develop on other part of my body including one which had to be cut out of my lower spine it horrid a aside from painful they leave scar doctor a yet are unable to find a cause and keep advising me get tested for diabetes every few month research online show that my case is not an isolated incident while one pointed the finger at extension made from real human hair i disagree a mine were synthetic despite her grim experience miss campbell said the experience ha not put her off call me crazy but after leaving it a while i gradually began to experiment with extension again she said it a confidence thing i guess especially when on a red carpet waiting to interview people who constantly have their hair coiffed to perfection ive worn wig in the past but prefer extension which give you so much more freedom ultimately i think that the key is to just know who is doing your hair and if you get a bad feeling no matter what the bargain dont take the risk it not worth it\n",

to two year they would also make change to the universal credit benefit system and take winter fuel payment and free tv licence away from wealthy pensioner something the tory have rejected at a press conference in central london mr clegg said we are going to spread the burden of finishing the job of fixing the economy fairly across society yes that mean more cut but it also mean asking the wealthiest to pay their fare share too he added our plan mean finding more than billion in saving from the welfare budget saving which ask wealthy pensioner to make a small sacrifice saving which involve fair adjustment to universal credit continued restraint on the rate of increase of benefit and a groundbreaking plan to reduce benefit fraud and error and get the most vulnerable off benefit

our society with pension rightly protected there is simply no benefit out there large enough where you can find billion of saving without hurting child or disabled people he added the conservative welfare plan are a dangerous deceit that will end up hurting the most vulnerable people in our society and million of the poorest working family it emerged that the lib dems have scaled down the amount of money they expect their mansion tax proposal to generate by million property valued at million or more would be subject to the party socalled high value property levy from which they say would collect billion down from the billion previously estimated mr clegg said adopting a reasonable and fair approach to the policy had resulted in the estimated revenue decreasing the lib dem leader added the charge proposed shouldnt scare the horse and used the same principle a council tax band in order to prevent oligarch who live in mansion paying the same property tax a a family the charge would be per year or le for property valued at million to million or le if valued at million to million per year or le if valued at million to million and per year or le if valued between million and

the assertion that the tax hike amounted to a new war on motorist insisting the measure wa to maintain the status quo on the revenue raised he said it a revenue retention measure we simply want to maintain the same amount of money from the overall vehicle duty system a we set out in this is just to make sure a the system shift around because people are buying lower emission vehicle we still generate the same revenue mr clegg challenged the other party to spell out in similar detail how they would balance the nation book he said the lib dems are the only party offering a balanced programme to pay down the remaining deficit and deliver a billion surplus while still finding money to raise income tax threshold to and invest in the nh setting out plan to eradicate the current structural deficit by mr clegg said his party wa giving an unprecedented level of detail about it financial plan and challenged labour and the tory to do the same mr clegg said labour plan involved billion more borrowing claiming they are playing russian roulette with your family future labour leader ed miliband lead a party that want you to think they can be trusted to balance the book without saying how they intend to do it he said they wont even tell you when they want to do it by he added warning that labour plan would involve extra borrowing he said it would mean an extra billion for

xi for sunday scottish cup semifinal against inverness the celtic striker scored a minute hattrick to guide his team to a handsome victory the treblechasing reigning champion came from a goal down inspired by kris common and the secondhalf introduction of griffith to record a win that take them eight point clear at the top of the premiership and lift confidence ahead of their trip to hampden hattrick hero leigh griffith with signed match ball and man of the match award darryl westlakes wickedly deflected strike early in the second half had given the visitor a shock lead completely against the run of play only for common to equalise in spectacular if contested fashion eight minute later a good and important a common wa for celtic though even his performance wa overshadowed by the arrival of griffith who simply exploded on to the scene with three goal of supreme quality in le time than it take for the average warm down rightly named man of the match despite playing for just over half an hour the former hibs front man eased all the fret and fear of home fan on a night that had looked to be slipping away from their team celtic leigh griffith right completes his hattrick against kilmarnock celtic had begun the night with a starting xi looking very much like the team deila might have been thinking about for hampden all thing being equal leaving stuart armstrong and gary mackaysteven both suspended for the semifinal on the bench suggested that he wa giving his cup formation a gentle run out against a kilmarnock team whose ambition rarely threatened to overreach their ability there were certainly passage of play that resembled nothing so uncompetitive a a training session with lee miller plodding along on his lonesome up front and only the pace of left winger tope obadeyi carrying even the hint of a threat to the home side the visitor doughty in defence but reliably clumsy on the ball were obviously intent on playing a containing game griffith collect the match ball after his secondhalf hat trick on wednesday night maybe just maybe theyd catch celtic sleeping and grab a surprise goal and if not well a nilnil at parkhead is never a disgrace right the problem for those who turned up in anticipation of a football match wa that however well celtic played attack against defence boast only so much in the way of entertainment value james forrest looked the most obvious outlet for a celtic breakthrough the winger scampering down the left and finding space where none should have existed though too often making the wrong call the former scotland regular might have scored himself with seven minute on the clock tearing into the box and receiving an emilio izaguirre pas at pace yet forrests first touch wa half an ounce heavy allowing young killie captain lee ashcroft to make a vital block on his shot substitute griffith came off the bench to spark celtic into life after lacklustre firsthalf it didnt take overly long for the crowd such a it wa on a night when empty seat abounded to grow frustrated by the home team inability to get themselves ahead virgil van dijk loping forward from central defence caused a few stir of excitement stefan johansens running beyond lone striker john guidetti promised at least a possibility or two still space in the final third remained at a premium home skipper scott brown should have done a great deal better with an izaguirre cutback on the halfhour mark failing to connect cleanly with the bouncing ball and watching it balloon high and wide of the target would setpieces of which there were an increasing number provide a more productive avenue of attack for celtic well big van dijk came fairly close with a flashing header from a common corner in open play an inability or unwillingness to let fly continued to be the running theme one great guddle involving guidetti and forrest neither finding that half yard needed to take a shot inside the box moving the local to howl of annoyance if they were irked by their hero showing le than perfect concentration in the art of opening up their opposition kilmarnocks opener had the home support in uproar when they took a hugely unexpected lead four minute into the second half celtic manager ronny deila left congratulates griffith after the final whistle two or three celtic player had a chance to close down and dispossess obadeyi a he made ground and tied defender in on the flank yet he kept hold of the ball long enough for support to arrive in the shape of westlake sure the midfielders shot took the kind of deflection for which there is no accounting smacking jason denayer and spinning beyond a helpless craig gordon but failure to apply due diligence at the back definitely contributed to the concession their fan roused and their own pride hurt celtic had to muster a quick response step forward the captain who pounced to nick the ball off the toe of sammy clingan prompting immediately complaint of a dangerous challenge griffith wa thrown into the fray before the game could be restarted forrest making way a celtic tried to provide guidetti with more support up front a substitution go not one of deilas worst griffith had been on the park all of six minute in fact when he put celtic ahead rising to score with a downward header after common had shown excellent skill and vision to drive towards the byeline beat his man and dig out a cross to the back post a soon a they went ahead the shackle seemed to fall from the limb of the home player suddenly they were finding space making killer pass creating opening and most importantly taking shot none better than the yarder that griffith sent screaming past craig samson with minute remaining the ball cannoning in off the keeper righthand post when he wa put through behind the defence four minute later there wa never any doubt about what would happen the striker finishing low and hard past a shellshocked samson\n",

            "scientist have revealed a sophisticated new dating technique show that little foot an important fossil of an early human forerunner unearthed in the s in south africa is roughly million year old the age of little foot ha been highly debated said geologist darryl granger of purdue university in indiana whose research appears in the journal nature the study found little foot a member of the specie australopithecus prometheus lived at roughly the same time a australopithecus afarensis the specie whose most famous fossil known a lucy come from ethiopia scroll down for video the researcher analyzed rock sample from around the nearly complete little foot fossil skeleton from thesterkfontein cave to gauge it age the researcher analyzed rock sample from around the nearly complete little foot fossil skeleton from the sterkfontein cave to gauge it age the specie wa much bigger and taller than lucy with gorillalike facial feature but fully upright and very strong with powerful hand for climbing like lucy little foot wa female it hand were proportioned like ours with a long thumb and relatively short finger and palm unlike the elongated hand of modern ape it leg were slightly longer than it arm unlike modern ape both specie blended apelike and humanlike trait but with different feature the researcher analyzed rock sample from around the nearly complete little foot fossil skeleton from the sterkfontein cave to gauge it age the finding may have important implication about the evolutionary relationship among humankind ancient relative our specie homo sapiens appeared roughly year ago earlier member of the human genus homo date back more than million year our genus wa predated by other specie on the human family tree including various representative of the genus australopithecus member of lucy specie were contemporary of little foot although lucy herself lived about year later like lucy little foot wa female the specie wa much bigger and taller than lucy with gorillalike facial feature but fully upright and very strong with powerful hand for climbing according to paleoanthropologists ron clarke and kathy kuman of the university of the witwatersrand in johannesburg the face of little foot which ha now been accurately dated for the first time it hand were proportioned like ours with a long thumb and relatively short finger and palm unlike the elongated hand of modern ape it leg were slightly longer than it arm unlike modern ape clarke and kuman noted similarity in facial structure and some teeth between little foot and the later human relative paranthropus indicating little foot specie may have been ancestral to paranthropus or a close cousin the new date for little foot indicates lucy specie wa not the only one that could have given rise to later member of the human family tree clarke and kuman said the fact therefore that we have at least two australopithecus specie living at the same time in different part of africa about million year ago raise the question of how many other specie there may have been which have not yet been discovered clarke and kuman said by email the team used purdues prime lab powerful accelerator mass spectrometer and a new detector called a gasfilled magnet detector to measure the radioisotope we succeeded in our measurement but we were surprised the date were so old said darryl granger a professor of earth atmospheric and planetary science at purdue the team used purdues prime lab powerful accelerator mass spectrometer and a new detector called a gasfilled magnet detector to measure the radioisotope we succeeded in our measurement but we were surprised the date were so old granger said we doubleand triplechecked our result running the measurement again and again the gasfilled magnet creates a different charge on the two radioisotope and throw the magnesium on a different path with a curvature that miss the detector this lower the magnesium ratio and increase the aluminum count in the sample that make it to the detector which result in a much smaller margin of error in the measurement some of the other material found at the site stone tool found at a different level of the sterkfontein cave also were dated at million year old making them among the oldest known stone tool in south africa the gasfilled magnet detector wa originally to be used to analyze sample of solar wind collected by the genesis spacecraft unfortunately the space capsule carrying the sample crashed in on it return to earth the crash delayed analysis of the genesis sample but caffee continued to build the detector and it wa completed the summer of caffee ha since used it to perform analysis for other project including those from the sterkfontein site only a few detector of this kind exist in the world caffee said we doubleand triplechecked our result running the measurement again and again the gasfilled magnet creates a different charge on the two radioisotope and throw the magnesium on a different path with a curvature that miss the detector this lower the magnesium ratio and increase the aluminum count in the sample that make it to the detector which result in a much smaller margin of error in the measurement ron clarke a professor in the evolutionary study institute at wit university in south africa hold the little foot skull among the oldest hominid skeleton ever dated at million year old according to an advanced dating method the date place little foot a an older relative of lucy a famous australopithecus skeleton dated at million year old that wa found in ethiopia the gasfilled magnet detector wa originally to be used to analyze sample of solar wind collected by the genesis spacecraft unfortunately the space capsule carrying the sample crashed in on it return to earth the crash delayed analysis of the genesis sample but caffee continued to build the detector and it wa completed the summer of the new finding suggest little foot roamed the earth at around the same time a the famed millionyearold lucy an australopithecus afarensis shown in a reconstruction above when discovered in hadar ethiopia lucy wa the only skeleton of the specie known she wouldve stood foot about a meter tall currently more than individual of this specie which lived between about million and million year ago have been uncovered caffee ha since used it to perform analysis for other project including those from the sterkfontein site only a few detector of this kind exist in the world caffee said one of the reason i came to purdue wa to be a part of the revolutionary science that can be done when such resource are applied to challenging problem these result highlight what can be accomplished through a collaboration that span multiple discipline it couldnt have happened without the unique skill and resource each person brought to the table inraps french researcher laurent bruxelles show little foot a fossil with both apelike and human feature found in a cave at the sterkfontein site near johannesburg the cradle of life is one of eight world heritage site in south africa in the hectare site site yielded the discovery of australopithecus sediba thought to be an early human ancestor that combine simian and modern human characteristic the worldrenowned sterkfontein cave is home to the oldest and most continuous paleaontological dig in the world it is also the site of discovery of the famous prehuman skull affectionately known a mr ples and the almost complete hominid skeleton called little foot granger original attempt wa the first time aluminum and beryllium radioisotopic dating had been used to determine the age of a fossil he developed the method in and first used it to study change in mountain river and other geological formation because of their very slow rate of decay these particular radioisotope allow dating to reach back million of year much further in history than the more commonly known carbon dating that can only stretch back about year he said only a small amount of the radioisotope remain in the quartz after million of year and it can only be measured by the ultrasensitive analysis of accelerator mass spectrometry we had given up and nearly walked away from the project thinking we had failed granger said then the new detector wa completed and we thought we would give it one last try sorry we are not currently accepting comment on this article\n",
